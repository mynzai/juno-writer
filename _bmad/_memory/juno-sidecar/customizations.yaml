# ─── PROMPT OVERRIDES ──────────────────────────────────────
# Supplemental instructions applied on top of existing commands.
# These are additive — they add constraints, they never replace.
# Use [CU] Override to create these conversationally.
#
# Example:
#   - target: write-content
#     note: Always default to first-person POV
#     instructions: |
#       Before generating, verify the scene uses first-person POV.
#       If not explicitly requested otherwise, default to first person.
