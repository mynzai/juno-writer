## Illuminating Juno — 2026-02-13 — Session 3: Article 2 Planning, Proofread, Research

**Article 2 created — "The Writer's Workspace":**
- Scope: VSCode for creative writing, why markdown, project structure, context window, thinking levels, other editors, import/export
- Outline: `illuminating-juno/02-drafts/writers-workspace-outline.md` (13 sections, ~212 lines)
- Series arc updated: new article slotted as #2, series expanded from 10 to 11 articles
- Key sections: I. Honest Moment, II. VSCode Tour, III. Why Markdown, IV. Project as Folder, V. Split-Screen Workflow, VI. Git Advantage, VII. Context Window, VIII. Thinking Levels, IX. Advantages, X. Disadvantages, XI. Other Editors, XII. Import/Export, XIII. Close

**Article 1 final proofread:**
- One fix applied: triple "It" sentence pattern on line 53 (collapsed three sentences into one with varied rhythm)
- Full self-violation check passed — no banned words in article voice, no reflective closers, no remaining rule-of-three in prose
- Article cleared for publication (draft comment block to be removed before publishing)

**Raven deployed for Article 2 research:**
- 502-line dossier: `_staging/raven/writers-workspace-research.md`
- 40 sources across 3 credibility tiers, 15+ deep-read via WebFetch
- Key finds: Jay Penner (16 novels in VSCode), P.D. Workman (70+ books in markdown), Steph Ango's "File Over App," 4 purpose-built VSCode fiction extensions, Git-for-writers movement, Pandoc as bridge tool
- Research gaps flagged: no hard adoption numbers, no controlled productivity studies, mobile gap unexplored

**[AP] Approved research:**
- Moved to `_knowledge/research/writers-workspace-research.md`
- Knowledge base index updated (now 3 items)

**Files created:** `02-drafts/writers-workspace-outline.md`, `_staging/raven/writers-workspace-research.md`, `_knowledge/research/writers-workspace-research.md`
**Files modified:** `01-series-plan/series-arc.md`, `02-drafts/writing-directives-draft.md`, `_knowledge/_index.md`, `project-memory.md`

## Illuminating Juno — 2026-02-13 — Session 2: Sidebar, Templates, Polish, Knowledge Base

**[WD] Sidebar added to article:**
- Blockquote callout in "Enter Writing Directives" section (lines 89-100)
- Walks readers through the six [WD] options: View, Set, Edit, Clear, Load Template, Scope
- Explains free-form input ("ban the word delve and never end a scene with a moral")

**Global directive template system built:**
- Created `_bmad/_memory/juno-sidecar/directive-templates/` directory
- Four templates: `starter-pack.md` (12 rules), `literary-fiction.md` (24 rules), `genre-thriller.md` (22 rules), `nonfiction-blog.md` (16 rules)
- Updated `[WD]` prompt in `juno.agent.yaml` (lines 1024-1052) with "Load Template" option, template discovery, scope selection, merge-vs-replace logic
- Templates are globally accessible to any project via [WD] > Load Template

**Polish pass on article:**
- Fixed five self-violations where the article broke its own rules:
  1. Cut "This article will show you how" — generic AI-style section closer
  2. "fluent, grammatically impeccable, and utterly generic" → two items, not rule-of-three
  3. Cut "It's worth your time" — adjacent to our own banned phrase list
  4. "metronomic rhythm... regularity of a metronome" → fixed double-metronome redundancy
  5. Rewrote "The Deeper Truth" ending: new opener ("Strip the word 'AI'..."), collapsed triple "It never" starts, replaced reflective one-liner with concrete images

**Knowledge base built and cataloged:**
- Approved [AP] both Raven research artifacts from `_staging/raven/`
- Filed to `_knowledge/research/` with updated classification headers, topic tags, cross-references
- Created full `_knowledge/` directory structure (research, references, media, glossary, style-references, notes)
- Deployed Vestry — built master index at `_knowledge/_index.md` with:
  - By Category table (2 items)
  - By Topic cross-reference (10 topic groupings with section-level navigation)
  - Recent Additions log
- Vestry handoff: `_staging/vestry/catalog-2026-02-13.md` (5 recommendations)
- Originals remain in `_staging/raven/` as record copies

**Files modified:** `illuminating-juno/02-drafts/writing-directives-draft.md`, `_bmad/custom/agents/juno/juno.agent.yaml`, `_bmad/_memory/juno-sidecar/project-memory.md`

**Files created:** `directive-templates/starter-pack.md`, `directive-templates/literary-fiction.md`, `directive-templates/genre-thriller.md`, `directive-templates/nonfiction-blog.md`, `illuminating-juno/_knowledge/_index.md`, `illuminating-juno/_knowledge/research/writing-directives-deep.md`, `illuminating-juno/_knowledge/research/writing-directives-web-supplement.md`, `illuminating-juno/_staging/vestry/catalog-2026-02-13.md`

## Illuminating Juno — 2026-02-13 — Session 1: Genesis + First Article

**Genesis phase:**
- Created project structure (adapted for blog series: 00-genesis, 01-series-plan, 02-drafts, 03-assets, _research, _staging, _knowledge)
- Wrote vision document: `illuminating-juno/00-genesis/vision.md`
- Drafted series arc with 10 article concepts: `illuminating-juno/01-series-plan/series-arc.md`
- Registered project as active

**Writing Directives article — full draft:**
- Outline: `illuminating-juno/02-drafts/writing-directives-outline.md`
- Draft: `illuminating-juno/02-drafts/writing-directives-draft.md` (~4,200 words, 8 sections)
- Working title: "The Rules That Set You Free: Writing Directives in Juno"

**Research (Raven deployments):**
- First deployment: deep research dossier from training knowledge (596 lines)
  - Artifact: `illuminating-juno/_staging/raven/writing-directives-deep.md`
- Second deployment: failed — WebSearch/WebFetch blocked for background agents (permissions issue)
- Third pass: Juno ran 10 web searches + 5 deep-reads directly, compiled supplement
  - Artifact: `illuminating-juno/_staging/raven/writing-directives-web-supplement.md`
  - 25+ verified URLs across 3 credibility tiers

**Raven YAML fix:**
- Added `required_tools` section to `_bmad/custom/agents/juno/sub-agents/raven.agent.yaml`
- Made WebSearch/WebFetch explicit and non-negotiable in critical_actions
- **Known issue:** Background agents (Task tool with run_in_background=true) can't get interactive permission approvals. User needs to add WebSearch and WebFetch to allowed tools via `/allowed-tools` or `.claude/settings.json` for background Raven deployments to work.

**Draft status — all 9 sections complete:**
1. "Read This Twice" — hook with before/after passage contrast
2. "The Paradox" — constraints create freedom
3. "What Makes AI Sound Like AI" — six tells with citations (Wikipedia, Nature, TechCrunch)
4. "Enter Writing Directives" — the system, two layers, five sections
5. "The Anti-Slop Playbook" — seven categories (A-G) with before/after examples and directives
6. "The Starter Pack" — 12-rule copy-paste template
7. "Living Directives" — feedback loop workflow
8. "The Deeper Truth" — directives = classic craft advice (Strunk & White, King)
9. "What's Next" — series cross-references
