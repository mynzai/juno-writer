## Session: 2026-02-16b (context window 9)

**Tasks completed:** 7
**Words produced:** ~2,578 (Art 12 finalized), ~550 added to Art 9

### Work Completed

**Article 9 — Research-Driven Writing (KB Expansion)**
- Reviewed Article 9 for [KB] knowledge base coverage at user's request
- Identified gap: [KB] got one paragraph, no walkthrough of actual interaction
- Wrote "The Intake Desk" section (~550w) with three concrete examples: glossary term (*casado*), JSTOR reference URL, Tomas scene fragment — each routed to different `_knowledge/` subfolder
- Added [KB] mention to "During writing" workflow paragraph
- Wraith scan on new content: TRACES (11 detections). Three-beat lists dominant (3), em dash violations (2), rhetorical question (1), summarizing closers (2), sensory slop (1). All fixes applied.

**Article 12 — Building Your Own Juno: Agent Architecture Deep Dive (Full Pipeline)**
- Outline created (7 sections: Opening → YAML Definition → Memory Sidecar → Slash Command → Sub-Agent System → Building Your Own → What Makes an Agent)
- User chose: guided walkthrough depth, name BMAD but don't dwell
- Creative brief written for Quill (2,500-3,000w target, 5 real YAML snippets specified, developer/builder audience)
- Quill (opus): 2,789 words. All 7 sections. 5 real YAML snippets embedded from source files. All 25 directives followed. Added 4th domain sketch (research coordinator).
- Wraith: TRACES (20 detections: 13 GHOST, 7 HAUNT, 0 POSSESSION). Three-beat list overwhelming dominant (15/20). Zero vocabulary slop. Technical nonfiction is structurally vulnerable but vocabulary-clean.
- Thistle: 211 words cut (10.1%). Throat-clearing, "is what" constructions, filler words, double descriptions. Protected closing: "Start narrow. Let use drive growth."
- Approved to 02-drafts/building-your-own-juno-draft.md. Articles 1-12 now publication-ready.

### Key Decisions
- Accepted Article 9's longer length (~3,350w) rather than tightening — KB coverage worth the extra words
- Article 12: guided walkthrough with real YAML, not conceptual tour
- BMAD named as foundation, focus kept on transferable patterns
- Goa novel through-line NOT used in Art 12 (architecture itself is the through-line)

### Voice Journal
- 4 new entries added (wraith-flagged x2, wraith-clean, thistle-delta for Art 12)
- 10 entries accumulated since last reflection — reflection due next session

## Session: 2026-02-16 (context window 8)

**Tasks completed:** 5
**Words produced:** 2,687 (Art 11 finalized)

### Work Completed

**Article 11 — The Humanizer: Cleaning Up After the Machine (Full Pipeline)**
- Outline created (7 sections: The Tell → The Taxonomy → Wraith at Work → The Humanizer → Kill Your Darlings → The Pipeline → The Honest Question)
- Through-line: this series itself as the running example. Real before/after examples pulled from Wraith scans of Articles 9 and 10. Meta-recursive angle acknowledged once in Section VI.
- Creative brief written for Quill (2,800-3,200w target, 25 directives, craft instincts, two Wraith scan reports as source material)
- Quill (opus): 2,818 words. All 7 sections. 6 real scan examples used. Self-edited 4 mirror/antithesis constructions during drafting.
- Wraith: TRACES (42 detections: 11 HAUNT, 31 GHOST, 0 POSSESSION). Top patterns: aphoristic closers (7), mirror/antithesis (5), template repetition (3). Clean: taxonomy structure, blockquote example, pipeline section.
- Thistle: 59 words cut (2.1%, 2,746→2,687). Leanest compression in the series. Throat-clearing, filler participles, one cut sentence. Protected: "The first version was a bumper sticker. The second is an argument." / "The architecture is waiting."
- Approved to 02-drafts/humanizer-draft.md. All Wraith and Thistle edits accepted.

**Series Arc Expanded**
- Added Articles 13-16 to series-arc.md (Loom, Phase Navigation, Short Form, Collaboration Patterns)
- Series now runs 16 articles. Pivot at Article 12: before = "how to use Juno," after = "what else Juno can do."

### Key Decisions
- Used the series' own Wraith scan reports as the concrete examples (meta-recursive approach)
- Section IV (Humanizer) intentionally shorter, proportional to the tool's depth vs Wraith
- Section VII addresses "what's human?" tension directly: direction, judgment, voice

### Pipeline Observations
- Aphoristic closers confirmed as dominant fingerprint alongside section-ending summaries. 7 instances in this draft, consistent with the 6 found in Article 10. The instinct to end on a quotable line persists.
- Mirror/antithesis appeared 5 times. Quill caught and fixed 4 more during self-editing. The craft instincts are reaching the drafting stage but the instinct still fires.
- Thistle compression trajectory: 12.8% → 5.3% → 3.6% → 2.1%. Drafts converging toward final. The pipeline is learning.
- Voice journal now at 6 entries since last reflection (threshold is 10).

### Series Status at Session End
- **Publication-ready:** Articles 1-11 (eleven of sixteen)
- **Not started:** Articles 12-16

## Session: 2026-02-16 (context window 7)

**Tasks completed:** 6
**Words produced:** 2,906 (Art 10 finalized)

### Work Completed

**Article 10 — Story Architecture: Tracking Threads Across 80,000 Words (Full Pipeline)**
- Outline created (9 sections: Two Boxes → Subplot Weave → Foreshadowing Ledger → Theme Tracker → Architecture in Action (centerpiece) → The Factual Foundation → Outline Reconciliation → When to Track → The Better Scene)
- Through-line example: dual-timeline literary novel. Past (1970s mother, family house, secret). Present (daughter inheriting, uncovering). Locked box collision as hook, convergence-point discovery as payoff.
- Creative brief written for Quill (2,800-3,200w target, 25 directives, craft instincts freshly updated, Lynx YAML + architecture prompts as context)
- Quill (opus): 3,190 words. All 9 sections. Centerpiece ~815w with subplot weave table, foreshadowing ledger table, theme tracker table, three revision actions.
- Wraith: TRACES (24 detections: 10 HAUNT, 14 GHOST). Top patterns: section-ending summaries/false profundity closers (6), mirror/antithesis (4), template repetition (2). Clean: centerpiece, Lynx blockquotes, opening anecdote.
- Thistle: 162 words cut (5.3%, 3,068→2,906). Implied phrases, filler qualifiers, redundant scope markers. Protected: "She did not forget the first box. She forgot she had already claimed the metaphor." / "Both honor the promise. Silence does not." / "Two moments in the same narrative space."
- Approved to 02-drafts/story-architecture-draft.md.

**First Voice Reflection [JV]**
- 11 journal entries synthesized (spanning Articles 7-9)
- Crystallized instincts written to juno-voice.md:
  - Patterns I No Longer Reach For: mirror/antithesis, false profundity closers, throat-clearing, filler qualifiers, template repetition
  - Patterns That Survive: concrete experiential prose, structured content with varied tones, dense specific images, varied entry points in parallel structures
  - Active Tensions: the framing problem (contamination in transitions), tightening convergence (improving or playing safe?), the mirror instinct (knowing ≠ not reaching)
- First reflection written to juno-voice-synthesis.md

### Key Decisions
- Dual-timeline novel as through-line (family house, locked boxes, 1970s/present — naturally generates the structural complexity that makes architecture tools essential)
- Craft instincts loaded into Quill's brief for the first time (post-reflection)

### Pipeline Observations
- Wraith's primary finding (section-ending summaries) is now confirmed across 4 consecutive articles. This is the most persistent pattern in the series.
- Mirror/antithesis appeared 4 times despite being explicitly listed in craft instincts pre-draft. The instinct outlasts the awareness.
- Thistle's cut rate: 12.8% → 4.0% → 3.6% → 5.3%. Slight uptick from Art 9, possibly because this article covered more tools (6 commands vs 4) and had more framing/transitional passages where contamination concentrates.

### Series Status at Session End
- **Publication-ready:** Articles 1-10 (ten of twelve)
- **Not started:** Articles 11-12

### Open Threads
- Real command output examples for Arts 4, 5, 6
- Voice journal at 3 entries since reflection
- Next: Article 11 (The Humanizer)

## Session: 2026-02-15 (context window 6)

**Tasks completed:** 6
**Words produced:** 2,819 (Art 9 finalized)

### Work Completed

**Article 9 — Research-Driven Writing with Raven & Vestry (Full Pipeline)**
- Outline created (8 sections: Errors That Feel Right → Two Tiers → Raven at Work → A Research Session (centerpiece) → Fact-Checking → Vestry and the Long Game → Building a Research Workflow → Back at the Table)
- Through-line example: Portuguese colonial Goa (~1510), feast scene. Cultural intermediaries (Goan Christians) as the surprise discovery that changes the scene.
- Creative brief written for Quill (2,500-3,000w target, 25 directives, Raven/Vestry YAMLs + research prompts as context)
- Quill (opus): 2,982 words. All 8 sections. Goa feast through-line in Sections I, IV, V, VIII. Centerpiece ~750w. Fact-check block quotes (4 claims, 4 statuses). Vestry index snippet.
- Wraith: TRACES (23 detections: structural dominant). Top patterns: mirror/antithesis (3), summary closers (3), rule-of-three (2), thesis-example-reflection (1). Clean passages: fact-check block quotes, Vestry section, research session core.
- Wraith cleaned draft produced (all 23 fixes applied).
- Thistle: 105 words cut (3.6%, 2,924→2,819). Filler qualifiers, implied phrases, typo fix ("absorves"). Tightest cut of the three Quill articles.
- Approved to 02-drafts/research-driven-draft.md.

**Housekeeping**
- Updated Article 3 status to publication-ready across all tracking files (was incorrectly marked as first draft)
- Voice journal: 4 new entries (11 total since last reflection, threshold approaching)
- Series arc updated

### Key Decisions
- Goa 1510 as through-line (culturally rich, multiple research angles, genuine surprise possible)
- Wraith's cleaned draft as standard pipeline step (scan + cleaned version, not just scan)

### Series Status at Session End
- **Publication-ready:** Articles 1-9 (nine of twelve)
- **Not started:** Articles 10-12

### Open Threads
- Real command output examples for Arts 4, 5, 6
- Voice journal at 11 entries (reflection at 10+ threshold)
- Next: Article 10 (Story Architecture)

## Session: 2026-02-15 (context window 5)

**Tasks completed:** 9
**Words produced:** 2,390 (Art 8 finalized)

### Work Completed

**Article 3 — Status Correction**
- Confirmed pipeline-complete from earlier session. Updated to publication-ready.

**Article 8 — Masque: Conversations with People Who Don't Exist (Full Pipeline)**
- Creative brief written for Quill from masque-outline.md (8 sections, Catherine session centerpiece, 2,500-3,000w target, 25 directives enforced)
- Quill (opus): 2,583 words. Catherine session (7 exchanges) hits all four beats: deflection, emotional shift, knowledge limitation, surprise (nickname avoidance as class armor). Actor's notes (5 categories). Nora/David Dual Voice snippet (4 exchanges).
- Wraith: TRACES (20 detections: 10 GHOST, 8 HAUNT, 2 POSSESSION). Top: mirror/antithesis (4), rule-of-three (2), false profundity closers (2). Catherine session near-clean; contamination in final expository sections.
- Thistle: 99 words cut (4.0%, 2,489→2,390). Throat-clearing, redundant modifiers, filler. Catherine exchanges untouched. All 25 directives clean.
- Approved to 02-drafts/masque-draft.md. Staging cleaned.

**Voice Journal:** 4 new entries (7 total since last reflection)

### Key Decisions
- Art 8: Thistle's tightened version (2,390w) over Quill's original (2,583w)
- Mirror/antithesis confirmed as recurring pattern across articles

### Series Status at Session End
- **Publication-ready:** Articles 1-8 (eight of twelve)
- **Not started:** Articles 9-12

### Open Threads
- Real command output examples for Arts 4, 5, 6
- Next: Article 9 outline (Research: Raven/Vestry) or draft remaining articles

## Session: 2026-02-15 (context window 4)

**Tasks completed:** 4
**Words produced:** 2,982 (Art 7 finalized)

### Work Completed

**Article 7 — The Sub-Agent Fleet (Wraith + Thistle Pipeline)**
- Wraith full-scan: 14 detections, TRACES verdict. Vocabulary nearly clean (Quill avoided all banned words/phrases/em dashes). Structural patterns dominated: mirror/antithesis (2), three-beat lists (2), enumeration overload (2), section-ending summaries (1), false profundity closer (1), template repetition across 8 agent sections (1 systemic).
- Thistle tightening pass: 436 words cut (12.8% reduction, 3,418→2,982). Killed throat-clearing openers, double descriptions, redundant pipeline narration. Restructured 3 sections (Lynx: lead with capability, Loom: lead with questions, Vestry: lead with relational hook) to break template monotony.
- Approved to 02-drafts/sub-agent-fleet-draft.md. All staging artifacts cleaned.

**Article 8 — Masque: Talking to Your Characters (Outline)**
- 8-section structure: Gap Between Profile and Person → How It Works → A Session in Full (Catherine centerpiece) → What Happens When You Surface → The Modes → Rules of the Game → When to Use Masque → Close
- Catherine session walkthrough: guarded mother character, deflection, nickname discovery, 6-8 exchanges planned
- 4 working examples specified (session transcript, actor's notes, dual voice snippet, transition moment)
- Estimated 2,500-3,000 words
- Saved to 02-drafts/masque-outline.md

**Housekeeping**
- Confirmed Art 3 (Finding Your Voice) already pipeline-complete from earlier session (was listed as "first draft" in memory but draft notes show Wraith + Thistle already done)
- Updated series-arc.md: Art 7 status (publication-ready), Art 8 status (outline complete), series metadata
- Voice journal: 3 entries added (wraith-clean, wraith-flagged, thistle-delta for Art 7)

### Key Decisions
- Art 7 approved with Thistle's structural variations over original uniform template
- Art 8 outline centers on single extended character session rather than capability survey (intimate vs. encyclopedic)

### Series Status at Session End
- **Publication-ready:** Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (seven of twelve)
- **Outline complete:** Article 8 (Masque)
- **Not started:** Articles 9-12

### Open Threads
- Consider real command output examples for Arts 4, 5, 6
- Next: Dispatch Quill for Article 8 draft from masque-outline.md

## Session: 2026-02-15 (context window 3)

**Tasks completed:** 3
**Words produced:** ~3,430 (Quill draft of Art 7)

### Work Completed

**Series Arc Update for Quill**
- Added [QL] Quill to all sub-agent fleet references across 6 files
- Updated command count 50→53, sub-agent count 7→8
- Files: series-arc.md, meet-juno-draft.md, meet-juno-outline.md, writing-workshop-draft.md, writing-workshop-outline.md, writing-directives-draft.md

**Article 7 — The Sub-Agent Fleet (Outline)**
- 12-section structure: Why Sub-Agents → Staging Workflow → 8 agent portraits (Raven, Thistle, Lynx, Masque, Loom, Vestry, Wraith, Quill) → Fleet in Motion → Close
- Agent order follows manuscript lifecycle: research → edit → check → create → curate → detect → draft
- 10 working examples specified
- Estimated 3,000-3,500 words (longest article in series)

**Article 7 — The Sub-Agent Fleet (First Draft via Quill)**
- Creative brief written to _staging/quill/article-7-brief.md
- Quill dispatched (opus model), delivered ~3,430 words
- All 12 sections present, all 8 agents covered personality-first
- Conductor metaphor threads opening, Section XI, and close
- Fleet in Motion section: 4 concrete workflow scenarios (research-to-page, drafting pipeline, continuity gate, character deepening)
- Directive compliance reviewed clean (no em dashes, no banned words, no mirror sentences, no false profundity closers)
- Draft in _staging/quill/article-7-draft.md, handoff in _staging/quill/article-7-handoff.md
- NOT YET APPROVED — still in staging

### Key Decisions
- Agent order in outline/draft follows manuscript lifecycle rather than alphabetical
- Each agent portrait leads with personality, follows with capability (meeting a person, not reading a spec)
- Quill's handoff suggests Wraith scan → Thistle tighten as standard pipeline

### Series Status at Session End
- **Publication-ready:** Articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 (five of twelve, all updated for Quill)
- **First draft:** Article 3 (Genesis)
- **First draft in staging:** Article 7 (Sub-Agent Fleet, pending approval + Wraith/Thistle)
- **Not started:** Articles 8-12

### Open Threads
- Consider real command output examples for Arts 4, 5, 6
- Art 7 needs: [AP] approve from staging → [WH] Wraith scan → [TS] Thistle tighten → publication-ready
- Article 8 (Masque deep dive) is the natural next article after Art 7 is polished

---

## Session: 2026-02-15 (across 2 context windows)

**Tasks completed:** 16+ (spanning compaction)
**Words produced:** ~9,050 total (~2,505 Art 5 + ~4,110 Art 4 polished + ~2,435 Art 6 polished)

### Work Completed

**Article 5 — Finding Your Voice (and Teaching It to Juno)**
- Outline created (10 sections: Voice Problem → Five Layers → CV in Action → Sample Guidance → VO Management → WA Writing → VB Blending → Voice Across Project → Juno's Own Voice → Close)
- First draft written (~2,505 words)
- Publication-ready

**Article 4 — The Rules That Set You Free (Writing Directives)**
- Reviewed examples against outline (4/5 covered, #5 correctly deferred to Art 5)
- Wraith full scan: LOW-MODERATE contamination, 19 detections (16 em dashes, 4 mirror sentences, 3 rule-of-three, 1 "here's the thing" pivot, 1 false profundity closer)
- Wraith approved → Thistle deployed: 62 edits, ~90 words cut
- Thistle approved → merged to canonical. ~4,848 → ~4,110 words. Publication-ready.

**Article 6 — The Writing Workshop (Craft Commands in Action)**
- Outline created (8 sections: Workshop Problem → CQ Four Lenses → PM Pacing Map → DW Dialogue Workshop → HK Hook Analysis → Diagnosis Not Treatment → Choosing Your Tool → Close)
- First draft written (~2,450 words)
- Wraith full scan: LOW-MODERATE, 15 detections (5 three-beat lists, 4 dramatic fragments, 2 em dashes, 1 mirror sentence, 1 hedging opener, 1 summary closer, 1 banned word)
- Wraith approved → Thistle deployed: 16 edits, ~15 words cut
- Thistle approved → merged to canonical. ~2,450 → ~2,435 words. Publication-ready.

### Key Decisions
- Art 5: Voice capture framed as "map, not clone" for honest expectation management
- Art 5: Juno's Voice Evolution as the reveal/twist ending
- Art 4: False profundity closer ("The rules will set you free") replaced with concrete ending
- Art 6: Framed as toolkit not sequence; diagnosis-vs-treatment bridges to Art 7
- Art 6: Varied presentation per command section to avoid repetition

### Series Status at Session End
- **Publication-ready:** Articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 (five of twelve)
- **First draft:** Article 3 (Genesis)
- **Not started:** Articles 7-12
- **Half the series drafted, almost half polished**

### Open Threads
- Consider generating real [WR] output with directives for authenticity (Art 4)
- Consider real [CV] output from series prose (Art 5)
- Consider real command output examples for Art 6
- Article 7 (Sub-Agent Fleet) is the natural next article
