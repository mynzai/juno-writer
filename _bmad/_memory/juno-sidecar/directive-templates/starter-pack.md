1. No em dashes. Use commas, periods, colons, semicolons, or parentheses.

---

## Banned Words & Phrases

2. Banned words: delve, tapestry (metaphorical), luminous, testament, beacon (metaphorical), myriad, multifaceted, seamlessly, nuanced, pivotal, profound, gossamer, ethereal.

3. Banned phrases: "hung heavy in the air," "a wave of [emotion] washed over," "couldn't help but," "it was a reminder that," "and in that moment," "the [noun] was palpable."

## Hard Rules

4. Never end a scene with a reflective or summarizing sentence.
5. Never name emotions directly. Show physical/behavioral evidence instead.
6. Prefer two or four items in a list. Break the rule-of-three default.
7. Never start consecutive paragraphs with the same word.
8. No metaphor may be followed by its literal explanation. Trust the image.

---

## Dialogue Rules

9. Use "said" for 90% of dialogue tags. No adverbs on tags.
10. Characters do not state their feelings directly in dialogue.
11. Characters rarely use each other's names in conversation.

## Structural Patterns

12. No participial phrase openings more than once per page. "Walking through the door, she noticed..." is an AI tell when repeated.
13. No mirror/antithesis sentences: "It wasn't about X. It was about Y." / "Not just X, but Y."
14. Do not stack transition words at paragraph openings (However, Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally).
15. No setup-pivot-realization pattern: "She had always thought X. But now she realized Y."

---

## Pacing & Rhythm

16. Vary sentence length dramatically: some under 5 words, some over 30. Fragments are encouraged. Never three consecutive sentences of similar length.
