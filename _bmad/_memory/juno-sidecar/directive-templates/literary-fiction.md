# Writing Directives — Literary Fiction

Builds on the Starter Pack with rules tuned for literary fiction: interiority, subtext, earned ambiguity, and prose that rewards re-reading.

## Formatting Rules

1. No em dashes. Use commas, periods, colons, semicolons, or parentheses.
2. Minimal exclamation marks. One per chapter at most, and only in dialogue.

## Voice & Style

3. Write like a human with a specific, lived-in voice. Vary sentence length wildly. Some fragments. Some that unspool.
4. Prefer plain, Anglo-Saxon words over Latinate ones when both work. "Start" not "commence." "End" not "conclude."
5. Favor close psychic distance — the prose should feel like it lives inside the character's perception, not above it.

## Banned Words & Phrases

6. Banned words: delve, tapestry (metaphorical), luminous, testament, beacon (metaphorical), myriad, multifaceted, seamlessly, nuanced, pivotal, profound, gossamer, ethereal, resonate, paradigm, vibrant, bustling, realm (metaphorical), utilize, endeavor.

7. Banned phrases: "hung heavy in the air," "a wave of [emotion] washed over," "couldn't help but," "it was a reminder that," "and in that moment," "the [noun] was palpable," "spoke volumes," "forever etched in," "the silence was deafening," "a dance of [noun] and [noun]."

## Hard Rules

8. Never end a scene with a reflective or summarizing sentence. End on action, dialogue, or sensory detail.
9. Never name emotions directly in narration. No "she felt sad," no "overwhelming joy." Show it through body, behavior, environment, or evasion.
10. Prefer two or four items in a list. Break the rule-of-three default.
11. Never start consecutive paragraphs with the same word.
12. No metaphor may be followed by its literal explanation. Trust the reader.
13. No profound realizations. No poetic one-liner endings. Earn ambiguity through situation, not clever closing sentences.
14. Never explain a character's motivation immediately after showing their action. Let the action stand.

---

## Dialogue Rules

15. Characters speak in fragments, interruptions, and incomplete thoughts.
16. Characters rarely use each other's names in conversation.
17. Characters deflect, evade, change the subject, and answer questions that weren't asked.
18. Use "said" for 90% of dialogue tags. No adverbs on tags.
19. Arguments are messy. Characters interrupt, repeat themselves, bring up old grievances.
20. Include physical business in dialogue: hands, eye contact, fidgeting.

---

## Pacing & Rhythm

21. Vary sentence length dramatically: some under 5 words, some over 30. Fragments are encouraged.
22. Never three consecutive sentences of similar length.
23. When the story accelerates, sentences shorten. When it slows, they lengthen and accumulate clauses.
24. A one-sentence paragraph is a pacing instrument. Use it.

## What I Want Instead

- Concrete, ugly, specific sensory details. The smell of burnt coffee. The sound of a shopping cart with one bad wheel.
- Mundane interruptions in dramatic moments. A phone buzzing during a confession. A parking meter expiring.
- Emotional weight from what's unsaid. The pause that goes on too long. The subject that gets changed.
- Imperfect details that serve no thematic purpose. Sometimes a red door is just a red door.
- Structural surprises. A scene that ends mid-sentence. A chapter that's three paragraphs long.
