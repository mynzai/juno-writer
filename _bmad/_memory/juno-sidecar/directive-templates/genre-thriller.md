# Writing Directives — Genre Thriller

Tuned for thrillers, suspense, and crime fiction: forward momentum, controlled information, tight POV, and tension that ratchets.

## Formatting Rules

1. No em dashes. Use commas, periods, colons, or line breaks.
2. Short chapters. If a chapter runs long, find the break point and split it.

## Voice & Style

3. Lean prose. Cut every word that doesn't push the scene forward. If a sentence works without an adjective, cut the adjective.
4. POV is a weapon. The reader knows only what the viewpoint character knows, sees, hears, smells. No omniscient drift.
5. Ground every scene in a specific place and time before anything else happens. Readers need to feel the floor under their feet.

## Banned Words & Phrases

6. Banned words: delve, tapestry (metaphorical), luminous, gossamer, ethereal, nuanced, myriad, multifaceted, testament, beacon (metaphorical), seamlessly, pivotal, profound.

7. Banned phrases: "hung heavy in the air," "a wave of [emotion] washed over," "couldn't help but," "and in that moment," "the [noun] was palpable," "little did [subject] know," "the silence was deafening," "sent shivers down."

## Hard Rules

8. Never end a chapter on resolution. End on a question, a reversal, or a door opening.
9. Never name emotions directly. Physical symptoms only: dry mouth, racing pulse, hands that won't stop moving.
10. No rule-of-three lists. Two items or get specific with one.
11. Never start consecutive paragraphs with the same word.
12. No dream sequences used to foreshadow. If the information matters, deliver it in the real world.
13. No villain monologues explaining the plan. Characters reveal through action and error.

## Dialogue Rules

14. People under stress speak in fragments. Short. Clipped. Incomplete.
15. Use "said" almost exclusively. The reader shouldn't notice dialogue tags.
16. Characters lie, deflect, and talk past each other. Every conversation has an agenda.
17. Characters rarely use each other's names. When they do, it carries weight.
18. Phone conversations are one-sided. The reader hears only the POV character's side.

---

## Pacing & Rhythm

19. Action scenes: short sentences. Fragments. One action per sentence. White space is pacing.
20. Quiet scenes earn their length by loading tension underneath the surface.
21. Vary paragraph length. A one-line paragraph after a dense block creates a punch.
22. Never three consecutive sentences of similar length.

## What I Want Instead

- Specific, procedural detail. How the lock actually works. What the gun weighs. The exact shade of blood on tile.
- Ticking clocks. Every scene should have a deadline, even if only implied.
- Information gaps. What the character doesn't know drives the reader forward.
- Physical cost. Characters get tired, hungry, hurt. The body keeps a tab.
- Misdirection through honest detail. Plant the clue in plain sight, buried in mundane description.
