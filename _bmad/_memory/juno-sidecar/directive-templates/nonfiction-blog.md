# Writing Directives — Nonfiction / Blog

For articles, essays, blog posts, and explanatory nonfiction: clarity, authority, voice, and respect for the reader's time.

## Formatting Rules

1. No em dashes. Use commas, periods, colons, semicolons, or parentheses.
2. Use subheadings to break sections. The reader should be able to skim and still get the argument.

## Voice & Style

3. Write conversationally but with authority. The reader is smart — don't over-explain, don't condescend.
4. First person is fine. Hedging is not. Say "this is wrong" not "this could potentially be seen as problematic."
5. One idea per paragraph. If a paragraph makes two points, split it.

## Banned Words & Phrases

6. Banned words: delve, landscape (metaphorical), paradigm, leverage (as verb), synergy, utilize, robust, streamline, revolutionize, holistic, cutting-edge, game-changer, innovative.

7. Banned phrases: "it's worth noting," "at the end of the day," "in today's world," "in order to" (just say "to"), "the fact that," "needless to say," "it goes without saying," "at its core," "in a nutshell."

## Hard Rules

8. Never open with a dictionary definition. Never.
9. Never end a section with a summarizing sentence that restates the point. The reader got it.
10. Avoid the rule-of-three in lists unless you genuinely have three things.
11. Never start consecutive paragraphs with the same word.
12. No rhetorical questions used as transitions. Make a statement instead.
13. If making a claim, support it. Assertion without evidence is noise.

## Pacing & Rhythm

14. Vary sentence length. Short ones for emphasis. Longer ones when the idea requires it.
15. The opening sentence of each section should hook — not summarize.
16. Paragraphs can be one sentence. They can also be ten. Match the content.

## Structural Patterns

17. No thesis-example-reflection paragraphs. Don't state a claim, illustrate it, then reflect on what it means. Make the argument and move on.
18. No mirror/antithesis sentences: "It's not about X. It's about Y." / "Not just X, but Y."
19. Do not stack transition words at paragraph openings (However, Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally). Vary how paragraphs connect.
20. No "And that's the thing" or "Here's what matters" pivots. The reader can tell what matters from the argument itself.
21. No false profundity closers: ending a section with a one-liner meant to sound wise. End on substance.

---

## Emotional & Persuasive Patterns

22. No hollow intensifiers: "truly," "incredibly," "absolutely," "remarkably." If the claim is strong, it doesn't need amplification.
23. No filler hedging: "It's worth noting that," "It's important to remember," "Interestingly." Make the statement.
24. No agreement escalation. Don't validate your own argument across consecutive paragraphs. State it once and defend it.
25. No vague attribution: "experts say," "studies show," "many believe." Name the expert, cite the study, or cut the claim.

## What I Want Instead

- Concrete examples over abstract explanations. Show the thing, then name it.
- Specific numbers, names, dates, and sources. Vague attribution ("studies show") is lazy.
- Honest acknowledgment of complexity. "This is complicated" beats a false binary.
- The reader's time respected. If a section can be cut without losing the argument, cut it.
- Personality. Voice. The sense that a specific human wrote this, not a committee.
