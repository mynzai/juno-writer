## Style Characteristics

### Sentence Structure
- **Average length:** Moderate to long (20-35 words typical for narration), but with dramatic range. Descriptive passages can run to 50+ words in a single sentence; declarative pivot-sentences drop to 5-10 words. The juxtaposition is always purposeful: an accumulation of sensory detail followed by a blunt factual statement creates the Flaubertian rhythm of expansion and deflation.
- **Variation:** Extreme and architecturally deliberate. Long, accumulating descriptive sentences alternate with short, devastating declarative ones. "She was dead! What a surprise!" -- two sentences, eight words total, after paragraphs of measured domestic narration. "Charles's trousers were tight across the belly" -- one sentence, flatly comic, inserted between Emma's elaborate ball preparations. The variation maps to ironic function: beauty is described at length; mediocrity is rendered in a sentence; the contrast IS the commentary.
- **Dominant patterns:** The "catalogue sentence" -- a long accumulation of concrete, specific details arranged in series, separated by semicolons or commas, building a world through exhaustive inventory rather than selective impression. "He smoked with lips protruding, spitting every moment, recoiling at every puff." Also the "temporal compression" -- years dispatched in a clause, decades in a paragraph: "Once married, he lived for three or four years on his wife's fortune, dining well, rising late, smoking long porcelain pipes, not coming in at night till after the theatre, and haunting cafes." Present participles carry enormous narrative weight, compressing habitual actions into continuous present.
- **Signature moves:**
  - **The ironic list:** A series of concrete details whose cumulative effect undermines the subject. Charles's father: "A fine man, a great talker, making his spurs ring as he walked, wearing whiskers that ran into his moustache, his fingers always garnished with rings and dressed in loud colours, he had the dash of a military man with the easy go of a commercial traveller." Each detail is individually neutral; together they compose a portrait of hollow vanity. The sentence pretends to praise while anatomizing.
  - **The deflating pivot:** A long passage of elevated feeling or elaborate description terminated by a short, flat, devastating sentence. After paragraphs describing Charles's happiness in marriage: "He rose. She came to the window to see him off." After Emma's elaborate romantic reveries about post-chaises and lemon trees: "Words failed her -- the opportunity, the courage." After the elaborate wedding feast: "The children had fallen asleep under the seats."
  - **The free indirect cascade:** Extended passages where the narrator inhabits a character's consciousness without quotation marks, rendering their delusions in their own vocabulary while the reader perceives the gap. Emma's Paris fantasies: "The world of ambassadors moved over polished floors in drawing rooms lined with mirrors, round oval tables covered with velvet and gold-fringed cloths. There were dresses with trains, deep mysteries, anguish hidden beneath smiles." This is not Flaubert's Paris -- it is Emma's, built from novels and fashion magazines, and the specificity of the detail reveals its secondhand quality.
  - **The objective correlative close:** A chapter or section ending not with a statement of emotion but with a concrete image that carries the emotional weight. The wedding bouquet burning: "The little pasteboard berries burst, the wire twisted, the gold lace melted; and the shriveled paper corollas, fluttering like black butterflies at the back of the stove, at last flew up the chimney." The object does the feeling.

### Word Choice
- **Register:** Neutral, precise, democratic. Flaubert's register does not elevate or condescend. The same cool, exact diction describes a farmyard dunghill and a chateau dinner: "Right along the outbuildings extended a large dunghill, from which manure liquid oozed, while amidst fowls and turkeys, five or six peacocks, a luxury in Chauchois farmyards, were foraging on the top of it." The word "luxury" is doing ironic work -- peacocks on a dunghill -- but the register remains steady. This flattening of register is SIGNATURE: beautiful and squalid things receive identical prose attention, and the reader must judge.
- **Specificity:** Extraordinarily and relentlessly specific about material objects, textures, colors, sounds, spatial arrangements, costs, and physical bodies. Characters are defined by their possessions, clothes, hands, and eating habits. Emma's nails are "shiny, delicate at the tips, more polished than the ivory of Dieppe, and almond-shaped." Charles's boots have "two long creases over the instep running obliquely towards the ankle." The specificity is diagnostic: these details are not decorative but revelatory. What a person owns, wears, and touches tells you who they are.
- **Vocabulary range:** Moderate breadth, extreme precision. Flaubert famously sought "le mot juste" -- the exactly right word. The vocabulary is not showy or Latinate; it draws from everyday concrete language: cloth, food, furniture, weather, body. But each word is load-bearing. "Garnished" for the father's rings (suggesting decoration without substance). "Accustomed" appearing repeatedly (the word of habit, routine, deadening familiarity). "Dreamed" and "dream" as Emma's characteristic verbs (signaling fantasy, not reality).
- **Signature vocabulary:** "Ennui" and "boredom" (the central condition). "Dream/dreamed/dreaming" (Emma's mode of existence). "Accustomed" (the enemy of passion). "Monotonous/monotone" (the sound of provincial life). "Mediocrity/mediocre" (the moral judgment). Concrete domestic words used with forensic precision: "puckered," "frayed," "scaling," "oozed," "sweated." Financial terms woven into emotional contexts: "fortune," "dowry," "economy," "arrears," "speculation." Colors specified with unusual exactness: "canary yellow," "rose-coloured," "silver-gilt," "pale saffron."
- **Avoids:** Abstract emotional language stated directly. Characters rarely "feel" things in named emotions. Instead, emotion is rendered through physical sensation, action, or object. Emma does not feel "trapped" -- she sits "making the tongs red-hot, or looked at the rain falling." Flaubert avoids editorial commentary, moral instruction, direct authorial judgment, exclamation, rhetorical questions in the narrator's own voice (though he uses them freely in free indirect discourse to mimic a character's thought), and all forms of sentimentality or exaggeration. He also avoids the picturesque -- nature is never merely beautiful; it is always weather someone is standing in, a field someone crosses, a tree under which something happens.

### Tone
- **Emotional temperature:** Cold to cool. The default is clinical detachment -- the temperature of a surgeon observing an operation, which is fitting for a novel about a doctor's household. Warmth enters only through accumulated concrete detail: old Rouault's memory of carrying his wife on a pillion through the snow, "her little rosy face, smiling silently under the gold bands of her cap." The passage achieves tenderness precisely because it is rendered in objects (face, cap, snow, horse) rather than emotions. The narrator never tells you to feel; the details create feeling despite the narrator's apparent indifference.
- **Narrative distance:** The masterwork of the novel. Flaubert invented -- or perfected -- the technique of "free indirect discourse" (style indirect libre), in which the narrator adopts a character's perspective, vocabulary, and emotional coloring without attribution. "A man, on the contrary, should he not know everything, excel in manifold activities, initiate you into the energies of passion, the refinements of life, all mysteries? But this one taught nothing, knew nothing, wished nothing." This is Emma's thought in the narrator's syntax. The "you" is her "you." The triple "nothing" is her frustration. But the narrator frames it without endorsement: we hear Emma and judge her simultaneously. The distance slides constantly -- sometimes close (inside Emma's fantasies), sometimes far (the flat factual summaries), sometimes both at once ("She had reached at a first attempt the rare ideal of pale lives, never attained by mediocre hearts" -- this is Emma's self-congratulation rendered in language that exposes its absurdity).
- **Humor:** Ironic, structural, and devastating. Three primary mechanisms:
  1. **The gap between aspiration and circumstance:** Emma dreams of midnight weddings with torches; she gets "a wedding at which forty-three persons were present, at which they remained sixteen hours at table." The comedy is in the brutal precision of "forty-three" and "sixteen hours."
  2. **The deflating juxtaposition:** Charles's romantic bliss described at length, then: "like those who after dinner taste again the truffles which they are digesting." Love reduced to digestion. Emma preparing for the ball "with the fastidious care of an actress on her debut." Immediately after: "Charles's trousers were tight across the belly."
  3. **The character revealed by habit:** Charles cleaning his teeth with his tongue, cutting corks of empty bottles, making gurgling noises with his soup. Not a single authorial comment -- the details compose the comedy and the horror.
- **Conflict rendering:** Oblique, material, and social. Conflict is expressed through objects, habits, and small domestic actions rather than confrontation. The mother-in-law war is rendered through: "the words 'daughter' and 'mother' were exchanged all day long, accompanied by little quiverings of the lips, each one uttering gentle words in a voice trembling with anger." Emma's contempt for Charles is expressed not in argument but in her noticing his boots, his nightcap, his eating. The deepest conflicts -- Emma's existential despair, her romantic hunger -- are rendered through her actions with objects: burning the wedding bouquet, tracing lines on the oilcloth with a knife-point, pouring eau-de-cologne over her arms.

### Imagery
- **Sensory emphasis:** Overwhelmingly visual and tactile, with strategic use of sound and smell. This is a SIGNATURE distinction from Austen (who avoids sensory detail almost entirely). Flaubert builds his world through what can be seen, touched, and smelled. Sounds enter for atmospheric effect: "the faint clucking of a hen that had laid an egg in the yard," "the monotonous ringing that died away over the fields." Smell functions as class marker and emotional trigger: "the warm smell of poultices mingled in his brain with the fresh odour of dew," "an odour of iris-root and damp sheets." Taste appears primarily through food, which is always specific and socially coded.
- **Metaphor frequency:** Low to moderate. When metaphor appears, it is precise, concrete, and often startling in its compression. The novel's metaphors tend to be brief and brutal rather than extended: "his heart full of the joys of the past night, his mind at rest, his flesh at ease, he went on, re-chewing his happiness, like those who after dinner taste again the truffles which they are digesting." "Her life was cold as a garret whose dormer window looks on the north, and ennui, the silent spider, was weaving its web in the darkness in every corner of her heart." "Charles's conversation was commonplace as a street pavement, and everyone's ideas trooped through it in their everyday garb." Each metaphor is SINGULAR -- it appears once, does its work, and disappears. Flaubert does not extend or elaborate metaphors; he deploys them like incisions.
- **Metaphor style:** Drawn from the material world -- domestic objects, food, animals, weather, architecture. Abstract states are rendered through physical analogy. Boredom is a spider. Conversation is a pavement. Love is a great bird with rose-coloured wings (but this is Emma's metaphor, not Flaubert's -- it reveals her romance-novel imagination). The most characteristic Flaubertian metaphor yokes the elevated to the mundane: romantic happiness compared to digesting truffles, the heart compared to satin shoes whose soles are yellowed with wax. This downward pull -- from the ideal to the material -- is the metaphoric SIGNATURE.
- **Physical grounding:** Total and omnipresent. Every scene is anchored in specific, concrete physical space. The Bertaux farm: "In the stables, over the top of the open doors, one could see great cart-horses quietly feeding from new racks. Right along the outbuildings extended a large dunghill..." Charles's house at Tostes: "A canary yellow paper, relieved at the top by a garland of pale flowers, was puckered everywhere over the badly stretched canvas." The ball at Vaubyessard: "The silver dish covers reflected the lighted wax candles in the candelabra, the cut crystal covered with light steam reflected from one to the other pale rays." Space is never merely described -- it is inhabited, and the inhabiting reveals character. Emma's boredom is rendered through the objects that surround her: the smoking stove, the creaking door, the walls that sweated, the damp flags.

### Rhythm
- **Pacing:** Controlled by alternation between scenic and summary modes. Flaubert compresses years into paragraphs (Charles's entire childhood and education: two pages) and expands single moments into pages (the ball at Vaubyessard: an entire chapter for one evening). The ratio of scene-length to story-time-elapsed IS the commentary: what matters gets space. Emma's fantasies receive as much page-time as her reality, because for her they are more real. Pacing accelerates through lists and catalogue-sentences (the wedding guests, the ball guests, the keepsake engravings) and decelerates through single, sustained sensory moments (Emma licking the liqueur glass, the sunshade in the thaw).
- **Paragraph length:** Variable and purposeful. Descriptive paragraphs are long -- 8-20 sentences for the wedding feast, the ball, the chateau. Transitional paragraphs are brutally short: "She was dead! What a surprise!" is essentially its own paragraph-unit. Dialogue paragraphs are short. The longest paragraphs are the free indirect discourse passages where Emma's fantasies unspool -- Chapter Nine's Paris reveries run to enormous paragraph lengths, the accumulation mimicking Emma's compulsive imagining.
- **Dialogue balance:** Dialogue constitutes perhaps 15-20% of the text -- far less than Austen. Flaubert's narration dominates. When dialogue appears, it is spare, often banal, and always character-revealing through its banality. Charles: "How good it is to be at home again!" Old Rouault: "I know what it is... I've been through it." Emma: "What a man! What a man!" The dialogue is not witty -- it is diagnostic. Characters reveal themselves by saying exactly the wrong thing, or by failing to say anything at all.
- **Punctuation signature:** The semicolon as primary instrument of accumulation -- long sentences built through semicolon-joined clauses that add detail upon detail, creating the sense of an exhaustive inventory. Em-dashes for interruption and emotional emphasis: "Words failed her -- the opportunity, the courage." Exclamation marks used sparingly but devastatingly, almost always in free indirect discourse to mark a character's intensity: "She was dead! What a surprise!" "He had lived at court and slept in the bed of queens!" "What a man! What a man!" The comma is the true workhorse -- Flaubert's sentences are built on comma-separated participial phrases that create a continuous present: "dining well, rising late, smoking long porcelain pipes, not coming in at night till after the theatre, and haunting cafes."

## Voice Notes

What makes Flaubert unmistakable is the **impersonality of the narration combined with the intensity of the observation.** The narrator never judges, never exclaims, never instructs. But the selection and arrangement of detail constitutes a judgment more devastating than any editorial comment could achieve. When Flaubert describes Charles eating -- "finished the remainder of the boiled beef and onions, picked pieces off the cheese, munched an apple, emptied his water-bottle, and then went to bed, and lay on his back and snored" -- every verb is neutral, every detail factual, and the cumulative effect is annihilating. This is the technique of "showing" perfected to the point where it becomes a moral philosophy: the world reveals itself if you describe it precisely enough.

The skilled mimic would focus first on this: **detail does the work of commentary.** Never state what a character is; describe what they do, own, wear, eat, and touch. The gap between the narrator's flat, precise description and the character's inner turbulence (or vacancy) is where all the meaning lives. To write in Flaubert's voice, you must be able to describe a man's eating habits and make the reader feel his wife's despair -- without mentioning despair.

Second: **the democratic gaze.** Flaubert lavishes the same descriptive precision on a dunghill as on a duchess's diamonds. The famous wedding cake -- "at its base there was a square of blue cardboard, representing a temple with porticoes, colonnades, and stucco statuettes all round" -- receives as much architectural attention as the chateau at Vaubyessard. This equality of attention is the mechanism of irony: by refusing to distinguish between the worthy and the unworthy, the narrator forces the reader to make that distinction, and in doing so, to question it.

Third: **free indirect discourse as the engine of irony.** Flaubert's greatest technical innovation is the ability to render a character's thoughts in the narrator's prose without any signal of transition. "A man, on the contrary, should he not know everything, excel in manifold activities, initiate you into the energies of passion?" -- we are inside Emma's head, hearing her romantic-novel expectations, but the narrator's cool syntax frames them as delusion. The reader sympathizes and judges simultaneously. This double vision is Flaubert's signature achievement, and it requires the writer to inhabit a character's perspective while maintaining absolute control of the prose temperature.

Fourth: **objects as emotional conductors.** The cigar case, the wedding bouquet, the plan of Paris, the little Italian greyhound, Charles's cap (that extraordinary cap!) -- objects carry the novel's emotional currents. They are never symbols in the heavy-handed sense; they are material things that accumulate meaning through the attention characters pay to them. Emma's relationship to the cigar case -- she "opened it, and even smelt the odour of the lining -- a mixture of verbena and tobacco" -- tells us everything about her longing without a single abstract word.

Fifth: **time as texture.** Flaubert moves between habitual and singular time with extraordinary fluidity. "Every day at the same time the schoolmaster in a black skullcap opened the shutters of his house" is habitual time -- the grinding repetition of provincial life. "One day when, in view of her departure, she was tidying a drawer, something pricked her finger" is singular time -- the moment that breaks the pattern. The alternation between these temporal modes creates the novel's distinctive rhythm: the suffocating repetition of routine punctuated by moments of sharp, almost violent particularity.

## Translation Note

This profile is built from the Eleanor Marx-Aveling translation (1886), the first English rendering of *Madame Bovary.* Translation necessarily alters word-level texture -- Flaubert's famous pursuit of "le mot juste" operates in French, not English, and many of his most celebrated effects (rhythmic cadences, vowel harmonies, the avoidance of repeated words within a paragraph) are language-specific. What SURVIVES translation and can be reliably analyzed:

- **Structural patterns:** Sentence architecture (long/short alternation, the deflating pivot, the catalogue list), paragraph construction, the ratio of scenic to summary narration.
- **Free indirect discourse:** The technique of rendering character thought without attribution is structural, not lexical, and survives translation intact.
- **Detail selection:** What Flaubert CHOOSES to describe -- the democratic specificity, the objects-as-conductors, the material world as moral evidence -- is independent of language.
- **Ironic architecture:** The gap between aspiration and circumstance, the juxtaposition of elevated and deflated, the accumulation that undermines -- these are compositional, not linguistic.
- **Temporal manipulation:** The movement between habitual and singular time is structural.

What may be TRANSLATION ARTIFACTS: specific word choices, adverbial rhythms, the relative weight of Latinate vs. Anglo-Saxon vocabulary, and any effects that depend on the sound of the prose rather than its architecture.

## Quick Reference

When writing in this voice:
- **Ground every scene in concrete, specific, material detail.** Name the color of the wallpaper, the type of cloth, the species of tree, the exact cost. Vagueness is the enemy. "A canary yellow paper" is Flaubert; "cheerful wallpaper" is not.
- **Let objects carry emotion.** When a character feels something, do not name the feeling. Instead, describe what they do with their hands, what they look at, what they pick up or put down. Emma traces lines on the oilcloth with a knife-point -- that IS her boredom.
- **Use free indirect discourse constantly and without signaling.** Slide into a character's perspective mid-paragraph. Let the vocabulary shift to match their consciousness. Do not write "she thought" or "it seemed to her" -- just shift. "A man, on the contrary, should he not know everything?" We are in Emma's head; no tag is needed.
- **Alternate between long accumulative sentences and short devastating ones.** Build a world through catalogues of specific detail, then puncture it with a flat declarative: "The cap was new; its peak shone." "She was dead! What a surprise!" The short sentence does the ironic work.
- **Never comment, judge, or instruct.** The narrator does not have opinions. The narrator DESCRIBES, and the description is the opinion. If you want to show a character is foolish, describe their actions with perfect precision and let the reader conclude.
- **Treat the elevated and the squalid with identical attention.** A dunghill receives the same careful description as a chateau. A peasant's boots are rendered with the same specificity as a duchess's diamonds. This democracy of attention is the deepest source of Flaubertian irony.
- **Render time through habit and interruption.** Build the texture of daily life through habitual actions ("Every day at the same time..."), then break the pattern with a singular event. The contrast between the habitual and the particular creates narrative momentum.
- **Use metaphor sparingly, concretely, and with a downward pull.** When you reach for a comparison, draw it from the material and the domestic -- food, animals, weather, furniture. Pull the ideal down to the physical: happiness is digesting truffles; the heart is like shoes with yellowed soles. Never let a metaphor float upward into abstraction.

## Sample Passage

The town hall stood at the end of the square, between the pharmacy and the notary's office, its facade of grey plaster cracked in three places and repaired with cement of a slightly different shade, so that the building appeared to be recovering from some disfiguring illness. Above the door, a clock that had not worked since the previous winter showed twenty minutes past four, which was no one's concern, since everyone in Beauville kept time by the pharmacy bell and the arrival of the evening coach.

Madame Varet had lived in the house opposite for eleven years. Her husband, a retired grain merchant who spent his mornings reading the departmental newspaper and his afternoons walking to the river and back, had long since ceased to interest her. He ate his soup at noon, his cheese at seven, and his prunes at nine; he wore the same grey waistcoat from October to April and the same linen jacket from April to October; and when she spoke to him of her troubles, he listened with the patient, empty expression of an ox watching rain.

Their daughter, Mathilde, had returned from Rouen three weeks earlier, having completed her education. She had learned to play the piano, to arrange flowers in the English manner, and to distinguish between the grades of silk by touch. These accomplishments, which had cost her father eleven hundred francs a year for four years, were now deployed in the service of a household that possessed no piano, grew no flowers, and had never owned a silk garment of any kind. She sat in the parlour each afternoon with a novel on her knees, turning pages without reading, her gaze fixed on the window, beyond which the square offered nothing more eventful than the pharmacy boy sweeping the step and the twice-weekly passage of the mail coach, whose horses steamed in the cold air and whose driver never looked up.
