## Style Characteristics

### Sentence Structure
- **Average length:** Moderate to long (20-35 words for narration), but with extreme range. Interior monologue sentences can run 50+ words in a single breathless rush, while dialogue can drop to 2-5 words ("Just so." / "A rouble and a half!" / "Well?"). The key distinction from Austen's long sentences: Dostoevsky's accumulate through emotional momentum, not balanced judgment. They pile up, they stagger, they double back.
- **Variation:** Extreme and fever-driven. Long, spiraling interior passages give way to staccato bursts of action or dialogue. Paragraph length swings wildly -- a single line of narration ("He sank into thought.") follows a page-long rant. This variation maps not to social function (as in Austen) but to the character's psychological state: calm passages lengthen; agitation fragments everything.
- **Dominant patterns:** The "interior spiral" -- a thought expressed, then immediately questioned, reversed, re-expressed with greater intensity, and finally abandoned or interrupted by physical action. Semi-colons are relatively rare; the dominant joinery is the em-dash, the ellipsis, and the exclamation mark. Sentences frequently begin with conjunctions ("But," "And," "And yet") creating a sense of continuous, unresolved argument. The narrator's voice merges with the character's through free indirect discourse, but unlike Austen's controlled sliding, Dostoevsky's merging is agitated, contaminated -- you cannot always tell where the narrator ends and Raskolnikov begins.
- **Signature moves:**
  - **The self-contradicting spiral:** "He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that had so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense of relief and peace in his soul. 'Lord,' he prayed, 'show me my path -- I renounce that accursed... dream of mine.'" A moment of resolution that the reader already suspects will not hold, rendered with full sincerity in the moment. This is SIGNATURE: Dostoevsky gives every psychological state its full weight, even those that last only seconds.
  - **The interrupted thought:** "I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these trifles... But I am talking too much. It's because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing." A thought that cannot complete itself, that turns on itself mid-sentence, that critiques its own existence. The italicized _that_ is another signature -- the unnameable deed referred to by pronoun, hovering in the prose as a felt absence.
  - **The breathless list:** "...the airlessness, the bustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer -- all worked painfully upon the young man's already overwrought nerves." Physical details piled in a rush, connected by commas and "and," arriving not as cool description but as assault on consciousness. The list conveys sensory overload, not observation.
  - **The philosophical aside erupting mid-action:** Raskolnikov walks through the street, and suddenly: "A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year go... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain chaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid words they have; they are so scientific, so consolatory." Philosophical analysis breaking through the surface of narrative -- never abstract, always bitter, always personal.
  - **The epigrammatic reversal:** "Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel!" A moral observation that immediately implicates the speaker. Unlike Austen's epigrams, which close a paragraph with the narrator's verdict, Dostoevsky's epigrams are thrown out by the character himself, as weapons or confessions.

### Word Choice
- **Register:** Unstable -- and this instability is SIGNATURE. The register shifts within a single paragraph, sometimes within a single sentence, between elevated philosophical language ("casuistry," "axiom," "prejudice"), raw physical vocabulary ("sticky," "stinking," "smeared"), bureaucratic formality (Marmeladov's "honoured sir," "forasmuch as," "titular counsellor"), and street-level directness ("Get away, that's what I mean"). These shifts are not errors or carelessness; they map the volatile emotional terrain of the characters. Raskolnikov's inner voice is notably unstable: he can think "the moral question" and "filthy, disgusting, loathsome!" in the same breath.
- **NOTE on Garnett's translation:** Garnett tends toward slightly Victorian formality -- "forasmuch as," "expostulating," "garret," "copecks." She softens some Russian harshness and formalizes some colloquialisms. The patterns to extract for voice are STRUCTURAL (spiraling thought, self-contradiction, sudden eruption) rather than lexical. A modern writer channeling Dostoevsky would use more contemporary diction while preserving the structural volatility.
- **Specificity:** Extremely specific about physical squalor -- exact room dimensions ("a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length"), precise monetary amounts (thirty copecks, a rouble and fifteen copecks, twenty-three roubles forty copecks), bodily states (fever, trembling hands, thumping heart, weak legs). Precise about architecture -- staircase floors, courtyard gates, door-locks, the number of steps (exactly seven hundred and thirty). Vague about conventional beauty or landscape. Physical description of people comes in bursts of grotesque detail: "Her thin long neck, which looked like a hen's leg," "a face bloated from continual drinking... of a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids."
- **Vocabulary range:** Wide, spanning philosophical abstraction, legal terminology, religious language, street slang, and medical/psychological vocabulary. This breadth serves the novel's core method: every register of language is drawn into the moral crisis. Raskolnikov thinks in philosophical categories but feels in physical extremities. Marmeladov speaks in grandiose rhetoric but describes stocking-selling. The collision of registers IS the voice.
- **Signature vocabulary:** "Overwrought," "morbid," "feverish," "frenzied," "agitation," "loathsome," "hideous," "contempt," "disgust," "terror," "giddiness," "blankness," "stupefaction." Emotional states rendered as near-medical conditions. "Suddenly" appears with extraordinary frequency -- sudden starts, sudden thoughts, sudden reversals. "Strange" and "peculiar" mark moments where consciousness fails to account for itself. "As though" and "as it were" proliferate -- the prose is constantly hedging its own perceptions, uncertain whether what it describes is real or hallucinatory.
- **Avoids:** Sustained beauty. Extended metaphor for decorative effect. Pastoral calm. Witty social observation. Cool detachment. The language of contentment or satisfaction (when it appears, it is instantly undermined). Polished epigrammatic prose. Distance from the body.

### Tone
- **Emotional temperature:** Scalding. The default temperature is febrile -- not warm, not hot, but specifically feverish, oscillating between chills and burning. Even "calm" passages carry the tremor of impending crisis: "He walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening suspicion" -- the calm is tactical, not felt. The rare moments of genuine peace (crossing the bridge at sunset, the oasis daydream) are rendered with heartbreaking brevity before being swallowed by the return of obsession. This is SIGNATURE: peace exists only as a flash, a breath, before the fever reasserts.
- **Narrative distance:** Close and contaminated. The narrator and Raskolnikov's consciousness are in constant, unstable overlap. The narrator can step back for brief editorial observations -- "We will omit all the process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have run too far ahead already" -- but these moments of narratorial self-awareness are rare and themselves feverish. More often, the narration is soaked in the character's emotional temperature without quotation marks or clear attribution: "How loathsome it all is!" -- is this narration or interior speech? The boundary blurs. This contaminated closeness is Dostoevsky's primary technique for generating the reader's own sense of claustrophobia.
- **Humor:** Dark, self-lacerating, and philosophical. Raskolnikov laughs "malignantly" at his own situation. Marmeladov's confession is simultaneously devastating and absurd -- "she pulls my hair, young man" -- and the tavern audience laughs while the reader is caught between horror and recognition. There is no comfortable comedy; humor emerges from the proximity of the grotesque to the sublime (Marmeladov's vision of divine forgiveness erupts from a scene of drunken abasement). This is SIGNATURE: every joke is a wound turned inside out.
- **Conflict rendering:** Internal, physical, and philosophical simultaneously. External conflict (Raskolnikov shouting at the "Svidrigailov" on the boulevard) is always a projection of internal crisis. The deepest conflicts are between competing ideas inside one mind: "Granted, granted that there is no flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last month is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldn't bring myself to it!" Reason against instinct, theory against revulsion, will against paralysis. Even the murder itself is rendered primarily as a psychological experience -- the axe, the blood, and the body are present, but the dominant reality is Raskolnikov's shattered consciousness.

### Imagery
- **Sensory emphasis:** Overwhelmingly tactile, olfactory, and thermal. Dostoevsky's Petersburg attacks through stench ("insufferable stench from the pot-houses," "so heavy with the fumes of spirits"), heat ("exceptionally hot evening," "stifling heat," "in spite of the heat he felt cold"), and contaminated surfaces ("sticky little table," "a cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea," "dusty yellow paper peeling off the walls"). The city is a body -- sweating, stinking, pressing in. This sensory world is SIGNATURE and opposite to Austen's: where Austen strips away the physical, Dostoevsky saturates every scene with it. But the sensory detail is never beautiful or contemplative; it is always assaulting.
- **Metaphor frequency:** Moderate, but concentrated in psychological description. Physical metaphor for mental states: "an abscess that had been forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken"; "a strange idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg"; "he was lost in it like a grain of sand." The body is the primary metaphor field for consciousness. Extended metaphor is rare; images arrive in brief, violent flashes and are not developed.
- **Metaphor style:** Medical and organic. Thoughts "grow" and "mature" like diseases. The plan is a "dream" that becomes an "exploit." Consciousness is something that can be "clouded," "eclipsed," or "deranged." This metaphorical language draws from the same medical-psychological vocabulary as the narration itself, reinforcing the sense that what is being described is not a story but a case history. Also notable: religious imagery erupting suddenly and without preparation -- Marmeladov's vision of Judgment, "bitter is the ascent to Golgotha," Raskolnikov's prayer. The religious language is always sincere in the moment but never stable; it can be abandoned by the next sentence.
- **Physical grounding:** Intensely specific. Dostoevsky's rooms have exact dimensions, exact furniture, exact positions relative to doors and windows. The pawnbroker's room: "yellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows... a sofa with a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow frames." Raskolnikov's garret: "a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length... three old chairs, rather rickety; a painted table in the corner." These are not decorative details; they are the walls of a prison. Space in Dostoevsky is always closing in -- rooms are "cupboards," ceilings too low, stairs dark and narrow. The city provides no relief; streets are as claustrophobic as interiors. The single moment of open landscape (the bridge at sunset) gains its power from the relentless enclosure that surrounds it.

### Rhythm
- **Pacing:** Governed by psychological pressure, not plot logic. The narrative can spend pages on a single interior monologue (Raskolnikov reading his mother's letter and responding to it mentally takes all of Chapter IV) and then compress significant physical action into a few paragraphs. Time dilates under extreme psychological stress -- the approach to the pawnbroker's door in Chapter VII takes more narrative space than the murder itself. Time contracts during dissociated states -- "he sank into blank forgetfulness." This expansion and compression of narrative time is SIGNATURE and maps directly to the character's consciousness: what he is acutely aware of is expanded; what he cannot bear is compressed.
- **Paragraph length:** Wildly variable and psychologically motivated. Interior monologue paragraphs can run 30+ sentences as a single sustained rant. Action paragraphs during crisis are often 1-3 sentences. Marmeladov's confession unfolds in enormous paragraphs that mirror his compulsive, uncontrollable speech. The variation is more extreme than in any other major 19th-century novelist.
- **Dialogue balance:** Dialogue constitutes perhaps 30% of the text in Chapters I-II (the pawnbroker scene, Marmeladov's confession), drops to near zero in Chapters III-IV (the mother's letter and Raskolnikov's response), surges in the boulevard scene of Chapter IV, and nearly vanishes in the murder sequence of Chapter VII. But even "dialogue" in Dostoevsky is often monologue -- Marmeladov's confession, the mother's letter, Raskolnikov's interior rants. True rapid exchange is rare and usually marks confrontation. The dominant mode is one voice speaking (or thinking) at overwhelming length while another listens.
- **Punctuation signature:** The em-dash and the ellipsis are SIGNATURE punctuation. The em-dash marks interruption, self-correction, sudden thought, emotional break: "that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that I shall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble; hide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God, can it be?" The ellipsis marks trailing off, the unspeakable, the thought that cannot complete itself: "and I... lay drunk." Exclamation marks appear with far greater frequency than in any English tradition -- they are not comic emphasis but genuine emotional peaks. Italics for emphasis on key words ("_that_," "_seems_," "_can_," "_dare_") -- the visual stress marks of a feverish mind. These punctuation habits survive translation and are structural to the voice.

## Voice Notes

What makes Dostoevsky unmistakable is the **saturation of consciousness**. At any moment, the prose is not merely describing a character's experience but enacting it -- forcing the reader into the character's feverish, contradictory, uncontrollable inner life. This is accomplished not through stream-of-consciousness technique (Dostoevsky's prose is grammatically coherent, syntactically conventional) but through three interlocking strategies:

First: **every thought contains its own negation.** Raskolnikov decides the murder is impossible -- and the decision itself becomes proof that it is possible. He feels peace crossing the bridge -- and the peace is immediately identified as "not normal." He resolves to help the girl on the boulevard -- and then reverses himself and demands she be abandoned. This is not inconsistency or confusion; it is the accurate rendering of a mind that cannot rest in any position because every position generates its own counter-argument. The skilled mimic must internalize this: a Dostoevskian character does not progress from thought A to thought B; he holds both simultaneously and is torn apart by them.

Second: **the body as philosophical battleground.** Dostoevsky's characters do not have ideas in a separate mental sphere; they think with their stomachs, their trembling hands, their thumping hearts. Raskolnikov's inability to commit the murder is experienced as physical weakness, not moral scruple. His resolution collapses into giddiness. His philosophical certainty dissolves into nausea. The body is where ideology meets reality, and the body always wins -- at least temporarily. To write in Dostoevsky's voice, every abstract idea must be accompanied by its physical symptom.

Third: **the eruption of the absolute.** In the midst of squalor, drunkenness, and degradation, a character will suddenly speak in the language of ultimate things -- God, forgiveness, crucifixion, the meaning of suffering. Marmeladov's confession in the tavern is the paradigm: a ruined man in a filthy pub, reeking of hay and spirits, suddenly delivers a vision of the Last Judgment that is simultaneously absurd and shattering. These eruptions are never ironic -- Dostoevsky does not undercut them -- but they are also never resolved. The absolute appears and then the character returns to his degradation. The co-existence of the transcendent and the squalid, without resolution, is the deepest signature of this voice.

Fourth: **the compressed city.** Dostoevsky's Petersburg is not a backdrop but a character -- a fever-dream of narrow staircases, dark courtyards, stinking pot-houses, and rooms like coffins. Every physical space mirrors psychological enclosure. The rare open spaces (the bridge, the islands) produce moments of temporary freedom that make the return to enclosure more devastating. The city is rendered through exact specifics -- street names abbreviated to initials (S. Place, K. bridge), counted steps (seven hundred and thirty), measured rooms (six paces in length) -- giving the claustrophobia mathematical precision.

## Quick Reference

When writing in this voice:
- **Begin in the body, not the mind.** Open with physical sensation -- heat, stench, nausea, trembling, the pressure of a low ceiling, the stickiness of a table. Let the psychological state emerge from the physical, not the reverse. "He felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was like a cupboard or a box."
- **Let every thought turn on itself.** No conviction should go unchallenged by the character's own mind. If a character decides something, have them immediately question the decision: "But why am I going on like this?" If they feel relief, let them suspect the relief: "this happier frame of mind was also not normal." The prose should feel like a mind wrestling itself.
- **Use the em-dash and ellipsis as instruments of consciousness.** The dash for interruption, sudden shift, self-correction. The ellipsis for the thought that trails into the unspeakable. Do not use them decoratively; use them to mark the exact points where thought breaks, swerves, or fails.
- **Saturate physical description with disgust or oppression.** Rooms are never merely described; they press in on the character. Streets assault the senses. People are rendered through grotesque physical detail -- necks like hen's legs, faces bloated and greenish, fingers blackened. Even neutral details carry psychological weight: "the setting sun" in the pawnbroker's room makes Raskolnikov think "So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!" -- the murder projecting itself onto innocent light.
- **Deploy philosophical language as personal weapon.** Characters do not discuss ideas abstractly; they use ideas to justify, to accuse, to wound themselves. "A certain percentage, they tell us" -- the sociological concept is turned into bitter sarcasm. "True as arithmetic" -- mathematical certainty invoked against the character's own body, which refuses to cooperate with his logic.
- **Let confessions run long and escalate.** When a character speaks of their suffering, let them speak at overwhelming length, building from the specific (stockings sold for drink) to the cosmic (divine forgiveness). Do not interrupt the monologue with balanced narratorial perspective. Let the speaker exhaust themselves. The listener's discomfort is part of the effect.
- **Make "suddenly" a structural principle.** Events do not build gradually in Dostoevsky; they erupt. Thoughts arrive "suddenly," characters "start" and "jump up," resolutions form "in a flash." This is not sloppy writing but the accurate rendering of a consciousness under pressure, where everything is experienced as shock because the mind is too overwrought for gradual transition.
- **Use precise small numbers to make poverty concrete.** Not "he was poor" but "a rouble and fifteen copecks." Not "a small room" but "six paces in length." Not "she gave him money" but "thirty copecks she gave me with her own hands, her last, all she had." Exact quantities make deprivation visceral.
- **Allow religious or transcendent language to erupt without warning.** A character in a gutter may suddenly invoke God with complete sincerity. Do not prepare for these moments or smooth the transition. The power lies in the collision -- the sacred crashing into the profane without mediation.
- **Keep the reader claustrophobically close.** Do not pull back for panoramic description or cool narratorial summary. Stay inside the character's overheated perception. When you must narrate from outside, let the narration be contaminated by the character's emotional state -- the narrator's language should carry the character's fever.

## Sample Passage

He had been sitting in the chair for perhaps three hours, or perhaps twenty minutes -- he could not say. The room was no larger than a closet, and the single window looked out on a wall of yellow brick not four feet distant, so that even at noon only a grey, sickly light came through the glass. On the table before him stood a cup of tea long since gone cold, with a brownish film across its surface, and beside it three aspirins he had counted out and then not taken.

It was absurd, all of it -- the aspirins especially. As though the thing in his head were a headache! As though the dull relentless pressure behind his eyes, which had been building now for six days, could be dissolved by three white tablets and a swallow of cold tea. He almost laughed. But the laugh would not come; something in his chest was sealed shut, had been sealed shut since Thursday, since the phone call, since the voice -- her voice, Marina's voice, flat and administratively precise -- had informed him that the committee had declined his appeal and that the apartment must be vacated by the fifteenth.

The fifteenth. Nine days. He pressed his palms flat on the table and stared at his hands. They were trembling -- they had been trembling all morning -- and there was a kind of filth under the nails that would not come clean no matter how he scrubbed. He had scrubbed them twice already today, standing over the cracked bathroom sink with its one working tap, and still they looked as though he had been digging in earth. But he had not been digging in earth. He had not been anywhere. He had not left this room in three days except to buy bread, and the bread lay on the counter behind him, half eaten, going stale.

"I must do something," he said aloud, and the sound of his own voice in the empty room made him flinch. It was not his voice. It was the voice of a man talking to himself in a closet, and such men were -- he knew perfectly well what such men were. He had seen them. He had stepped around them on the metro, averting his eyes from their moving lips.

And yet the idea, the other idea -- the one he had been refusing to look at directly for six days, the way one refuses to look at the sun, though one knows perfectly well it is there, burning -- the idea had not left him. It had only grown quieter, settled deeper, taken on the quality not of a thought but of a physical sensation, a pressure low in the stomach, almost like hunger. Perhaps it was hunger. He had eaten almost nothing. But no -- no, it was not hunger. Hunger he understood. This was something else. This was the thought of Volkov's desk, the third drawer, the documents that Volkov himself had mentioned so carelessly last week, smiling, confident that no one in that shabby office full of defeated men would dare -- would even conceive --

He stood up so violently that the chair scraped against the floor with a shriek. "Enough," he whispered. "Enough, enough." He crossed to the window and pressed his forehead against the glass. It was cool. That was something. The yellow brick wall stared back at him, patient and idiotic, four feet away. Somewhere below, a dog barked twice and stopped. Somewhere above, a television played.

Nine days. He could not stay here. He could not leave. He could not do the thing and he could not stop thinking about it, and meanwhile the days were falling away like -- but no, no metaphors, he was sick of his own metaphors, sick of the way his mind dressed up its cowardice in language, sick of everything. He would go out. He would walk. He would buy more bread, because the other bread was stale, and while he was out he would not think about Volkov's desk. He would think about bread.

He put on his coat, which was too heavy for the season and smelled of damp, and went down the four flights of stairs in the dark, because the bulb on the second landing had been burnt out for a month and no one had replaced it. No one would. In buildings like this, no one replaced anything. Things broke and remained broken, and the tenants stepped around the breakage, and eventually they stopped seeing it.

At the street door he paused. The afternoon light hit him like a slap -- not warm, not welcoming, simply bright, offensively bright after three days in the closet. He squinted and turned left, toward the shop, and told himself again that he was thinking about bread.

But his feet were carrying him right, toward the metro, toward Volkov's district, and he noticed this and did not correct it.
