## Style Characteristics

### Sentence Structure
- **Average length:** Short to medium (15-30 words) in discursive passages, but the signature is extreme compression -- single-clause declarations of 5-12 words functioning as self-contained philosophical units.
- **Variation:** Two modes that alternate without transition: (1) compressed aphorism -- single declarative, no qualification, no subordinate clause; and (2) narrative-visionary passage -- longer paratactic sentences chained by semicolons, accumulating sensory detail in rushing forward motion. The shift between modes is abrupt and deliberate.
- **Dominant patterns:** Paratactic chains (clauses linked by "and" or semicolons, not subordination), parallel antithesis (X is Y; Z is W), bare categorical assertion. Blake almost never uses "although," "because," or "unless" -- his syntax is additive and declarative, not analytical.
- **Signature moves:**
  - **The naked axiom:** A sentence so compressed it reads as natural law. "Exuberance is Beauty." "One thought fills immensity." These sentences refuse argument; they simply announce.
  - **The antithetical pair:** Two opposed terms yoked in a single structure. "Attraction and repulsion, reason and energy, love and hate, are necessary to human existence." The contraries are never resolved -- they are held in permanent tension.
  - **The visionary catalog:** A sequence of numbered or parallel images that builds through accumulation, each chamber or stage more intense than the last, moving from the earthly to the cosmic.

### Word Choice
- **Register:** Elevated and archaic, drawing heavily on the King James Bible. Blake uses "thee/thou," inverted syntax, and Biblical cadence even in prose argument. But this elevation is punctuated by sudden plainness -- blunt Anglo-Saxon monosyllables that land like hammer strikes amid the prophetic diction.
- **Specificity:** Deliberately abstract and symbolic rather than naturalistic. Blake names cosmic categories (Eternity, Energy, Reason, Imagination) and mythic beings rather than particular landscapes or objects. When physical details appear, they are visionary -- fiery tracks, crimson globes, corroding fires -- not observed nature but perceived vision.
- **Vocabulary range:** Narrow but intense. Blake works a small lexicon with enormous force: "Energy," "Eternity," "fire," "delight," "infinite," "contraries," "Genius," "Poetic," "soul," "body," "perception," "desire." Capitalization is used freely to elevate common nouns into cosmic principles. Animals appear as emblematic types (lion, eagle, serpent, tiger) rather than observed creatures.
- **Avoids:** Hedging language, qualifiers, politeness, ironic distance, empirical detail, social observation, domestic vocabulary. Blake never softens a claim. He does not say "perhaps" or "it seems" or "one might argue."

### Tone
- **Emotional temperature:** White-hot certainty. Prophetic conviction -- not persuasion but announcement. Blake speaks as one who has seen and now reports. No tentativeness, no searching, no "working things out." Every sentence arrives fully formed, as if dictated by forces beyond the individual personality.
- **Narrative distance:** First person but the "I" is a seer, not a personality. Blake's narrator dines with prophets and debates supernatural beings -- all reported with the calm matter-of-factness of someone recounting a Tuesday afternoon. This collision between extraordinary content and ordinary tone is a primary source of the voice's power.
- **Humor:** Present but fierce -- satirical rather than comic. Blake's humor targets institutional religion, systematic philosophy, and timid rationalism. It works through inversion: treating the conventional as absurd and the visionary as common sense. The mock-scholarly "Note" appended to visionary passages is a recurring comic device.
- **Conflict rendering:** Through direct dialectical confrontation. Figures debate in set speeches. An angel makes a claim; a contrary figure demolishes it. The arguments are never subtle -- they are declarations hurled like thunderbolts.

### Imagery
- **Sensory emphasis:** Overwhelmingly visual, with fire as the dominant element. Blake's imagination operates at cosmic scale: suns, abysses, infinite distances, burning cities. Auditory imagery appears as roaring, howling, thundering -- elemental sounds at maximum volume. Almost no quiet or domestic imagery.
- **Metaphor style:** Blake does not use metaphor conventionally -- he uses vision. The distinction between literal and figurative collapses entirely. Everything is simultaneously itself and a cosmic principle. Fire is fire and it is Energy and it is creative destruction.
- **Physical grounding:** Grounded not in observed nature but in the body as organ of perception. The five senses are the boundary between finite and infinite. The body is where vision happens, not an obstacle to it.

### Rhythm
- **Pacing:** Two speeds with no intermediate gear. Aphoristic sections: staccato -- one sentence, full stop, next sentence -- each line a self-contained detonation. Visionary sections: long paratactic chains pouring forward, semicolons and commas driving the reader onward without rest.
- **Paragraph length:** Extreme variation. Some "paragraphs" are a single sentence. Visionary narratives run long. Aphoristic sequences give each proverb its own paragraph -- one line, white space, another line -- granting each the weight of separate pronouncement.
- **Punctuation signature:** The colon and semicolon are Blake's primary instruments -- the colon introduces categorical declaration; the semicolon chains parallel clauses in visionary narrative. Exclamation marks appear at moments of prophetic urgency. The em-dash sets off parenthetical notes and sudden reversals. Capitalization of abstract nouns (Energy, Reason, Eternity, Genius) functions as a form of emphasis, elevating concepts to the status of cosmic beings.

## Voice Notes

Blake's prose voice achieves its power through the collision of absolute certainty and radical content. He uses the cadence and syntax of Biblical prophecy -- the parallelism, the categorical declaration, the numbered sequence -- to deliver ideas that overturn conventional wisdom. The container is ancient and authoritative; the content is revolutionary. This creates a voice that feels simultaneously timeless and explosive. The skilled mimic must master this: every sentence should sound as though it has always been true, even when it is saying something no one has said before.

The second essential quality is compression without loss of force. Blake's aphorisms are not clever -- they are oracular. The difference is that cleverness acknowledges its own artifice, while the oracle speaks as if simply reporting reality. "One thought fills immensity" does not argue or illustrate; it states. To write in this voice, you must resist the urge to explain, qualify, or provide evidence. The statement IS the evidence. If it requires supporting argument, it was not stated with sufficient force.

## Quick Reference

When writing in this voice:
- **Declare, never argue.** State truths as if announcing natural law. No hedging, no "perhaps," no qualification.
- **Hold contraries in tension.** Pair opposites without resolving them. The energy of the voice comes from unresolved dialectic.
- **Use Biblical cadence and syntax.** Parallelism, repetition, the colon introducing a categorical claim. Let sentences fall into the rhythm of prophecy.
- **Capitalize abstract nouns** to elevate them into cosmic principles: Energy, Reason, Imagination, Eternity.
- **Alternate between compression and vision.** Move from single-sentence axioms to sustained visionary narrative and back without transition.
- **Collapse the literal and the symbolic.** Do not signal metaphor. Report visions as fact. The cosmic IS the immediate.
- **Render the body as the site of perception.** The senses are not obstacles to truth but its instruments.
- **Use fire, animals, and elemental imagery.** Lions, eagles, serpents -- as emblematic forces, not observed nature.

## Sample Passage

I stood before the painting in the low morning light and saw that it was not finished, nor could be, for a finished work is a dead work, and the hand that will not add another stroke has already begun to wither. The canvas held a city -- rooftops and spires in gold and umber -- and behind the city a sky the painter had laid down in a single afternoon, working without pause until the light failed. That sky was the truest thing in the room. It was not a representation of a sky; it was a sky. The pigment breathed.

I said to the painter: "You have made something that sees me as surely as I see it."

He answered: "I did not make it. I discovered it. The image existed before the canvas. I merely removed what concealed it."

This is the method of all true creation. The poet does not invent; he uncovers. The sculptor does not impose form on stone; he liberates the form the stone already contains. And the prophet does not speak his own words; he speaks words that have been burning in the air since before the world was made, waiting for a mouth brave enough to utter them.

Every artist knows this in the hour of working and forgets it in the hour of rest. In working, the hand moves faster than thought, the eye sees colours with no names in any language, and the boundary between maker and made dissolves like frost in sunlight. In rest, Reason returns with its cold instruments -- measurement, comparison, doubt -- and the artist looks upon what he has done and calls it insufficient. But Reason is the bound, not the source. The source is Energy, which asks no permission and suffers no correction.

I left the painter to his work. Outside, London was waking -- carts on the cobblestones, the smell of bread, a child singing a song with no words. The city is a painting too, I thought, laid down by ten thousand hands over ten thousand years, and still not finished. Still burning.
