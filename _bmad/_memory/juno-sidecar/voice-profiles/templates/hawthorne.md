## Style Characteristics

### Sentence Structure
- **Average length:** Long, often 35-60 words in narrative passages, with some sentences running past 80 words. Hawthorne constructs prose cathedrals: multi-clausal, architecturally braced with dashes and semicolons, suspended between qualifications. The reader is held in syntactic suspense while the sentence accumulates meaning before resolving in a moral observation or image.
- **Variation:** Less extreme than might be expected. Hawthorne rarely drops below 15 words even for emphasis. His shortest sentences tend to be rhetorical questions or epigrammatic moral pronouncements: "Had Hester sinned alone?" "It was not love, but instinct." "Yes!—these were her realities,—all else had vanished!" These arrive as punctuation marks after long, building passages -- the sudden descent from complexity into simplicity is devastating precisely because it is rare.
- **Dominant patterns:** The **suspended periodic sentence** is Hawthorne's signature structural unit. The main clause is delayed by a cascade of subordinate clauses, participial phrases, appositives, and parenthetical qualifications, all held aloft by em-dashes and semicolons, until the sentence finally lands on its predicate like a gavel. "In my native town of Salem, at the head of what, half a century ago, in the days of old King Derby, was a bustling wharf,—but which is now burdened with decayed wooden warehouses, and exhibits few or no symptoms of commercial life; except, perhaps, a bark or brig, half-way down its melancholy length, discharging hides;—at the head, I say, of this dilapidated wharf..." The reader must hold multiple frames in mind simultaneously.
- **Signature moves:**
  - **The moral pivot:** A long descriptive or narrative passage that turns, at its close, into a generalized moral reflection. After describing Hester's walk from prison: "In our nature, however, there is a provision, alike marvellous and merciful, that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture, but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it." The pivot moves from particular to universal, from narrative to essay, without breaking stride.
  - **The suspended catalogue:** A list of alternative possibilities, each introduced by "It might be" or similar conditional phrasing, building speculative weight before resolving. "It might be that a sluggish bond-servant... was to be corrected at the whipping-post. It might be, that an Antinomian, a Quaker, or other heterodox religionist was to be scourged out of the town... It might be, too, that a witch, like old Mistress Hibbins... was to die upon the gallows." Three possibilities, each darker than the last, enacting the Puritan imagination's appetite for punishment.
  - **The parenthetical confession:** In the first-person Custom-House mode, Hawthorne interrupts his own sentence to address the reader with a disclaimer or aside, enclosed in dashes: "It seemed to me,—the reader may smile, but must not doubt my word,—it seemed to me, then, that I experienced a sensation not altogether physical, yet almost so, of burning heat." The interruption creates an intimacy that is simultaneously self-deprecating and insistent.
  - **The accumulating negation:** Defining a character or condition by layering what it is NOT, until the absence becomes a presence. Of the Inspector: "He possessed no power of thought, no depth of feeling, no troublesome sensibilities; nothing, in short, but a few commonplace instincts." Of Hester's exclusion: "nothing that made her feel as if she belonged to it."

### Word Choice
- **Register:** Elevated, Latinate, and deliberately archaic even for its period. Hawthorne writes in a register that evokes the seventeenth century while remaining intelligible to the nineteenth -- a double temporal consciousness. Key Latinate terms: "ignominy," "contumely," "physiognomies," "preternatural," "evanescent," "lurid," "torpid," "inquisitorial," "efficacious." Yet this Latinate formality is punctuated by sudden Anglo-Saxon plainness that hits like a physical blow: "dust for dust," "the pang that rankles," "the spot never grew callous."
- **Specificity:** Hawthorne is specific about moral and psychological states, vague about mundane physical detail. He will tell you precisely what a character's conscience feels but not what they had for breakfast (unless, as with the Inspector, appetite IS the character). Physical description exists to serve symbolic function: Hester's dark hair and black eyes signify passion; the scarlet letter is described with jeweler's precision because it IS the story's moral center. Landscape is rendered in moral terms: the cottage's sterile soil and comparative remoteness signify Hester's exclusion; the forest is not described ecologically but as a zone of moral wildness.
- **Vocabulary range:** Broad and deliberately literary. Hawthorne draws on theological, legal, medical, and alchemical vocabularies to create a sense of multiple interpretive frames converging on a single image. The scarlet letter is simultaneously a legal sentence, a religious stigma, a work of art, a magical talisman, and a psychological wound. Each vocabulary contributes its own coloring.
- **Signature vocabulary:** "Ignominy," "scaffold," "scarlet," "token," "brand," "stigma," "doom," "morbid," "lurid," "sombre," "dusky," "torpid," "phantasmagoric," "preternatural," "penal," "tribunal," "transgressor," "penance," "martyr," "frailty," "sin." Also the hedging and qualifying words that calibrate moral judgment: "methinks," "perchance," "it may be," "not unfrequently," "it is to be feared," "we may speak further of it hereafter." These qualifiers are not weakness but deliberate moral tentativeness -- Hawthorne refuses to pronounce final judgment.
- **Avoids:** Colloquialism in narration (though dialogue is period-appropriate), modern psychological terminology, scientific language, brevity for its own sake, humor without moral undertow, purely decorative description. Hawthorne never describes something simply because it is beautiful; beauty in his prose is always implicated in moral meaning. He also avoids the first person in the novel chapters (reserving it for "The Custom-House"), maintaining instead an omniscient narrator who is both intimate with and elevated above the characters.

### Tone
- **Emotional temperature:** Warm but grave. Hawthorne's default temperature is a kind of sympathetic solemnity -- he feels for his characters but does not weep with them. The warmth is most evident in his treatment of Hester, whom he describes with an almost protective tenderness even as he anatomizes her suffering. "Perhaps there was a more real torture in her first unattended footsteps from the threshold of the prison, than even in the procession and spectacle that have been described." That "perhaps" is characteristic: Hawthorne approaches his characters' pain with the delicacy of a man who knows he cannot fully enter it. The Custom-House sections are warmer still, verging on rueful comedy, but always with an undertone of melancholy -- the humor of a man who sees the absurdity of human arrangements without being freed from their grip.
- **Narrative distance:** Hawthorne operates at omniscient middle distance. He is closer to his characters than a pure essayist but further than a modern psychologist. He enters Hester's consciousness but always with a moralizing frame: "Possibly, it was an instinctive device of her spirit, to relieve itself, by the exhibition of these phantasmagoric forms, from the cruel weight and hardness of the reality." The "possibly" keeps the narrator one step removed from certainty. This is SIGNATURE: Hawthorne's narrator theorizes about his characters' inner lives rather than simply reporting them. He offers interpretations, not transcriptions. The narrator is a moral philosopher contemplating a specimen of human experience, not a consciousness merged with it.
- **Humor:** Present but always shadowed. In "The Custom-House," the humor is mordant and self-deprecating: "What is he?" murmurs one gray shadow of my forefathers to the other. "A writer of story-books!" In the novel chapters, humor darkens into irony that is almost savage: the women outside the jail who advocate branding, stripping, and death are simultaneously comic in their bloodthirstiness and horrifying in their righteousness. The Inspector's portrait is the purest comedy in the source text -- a man "so perfect, in one point of view; so shallow, so delusive, so impalpable, such an absolute nonentity, in every other" -- but even here the humor carries a moral sting: this portrait of animal contentment is an implicit argument about what a soul costs.
- **Conflict rendering:** Internalized and symbolic. External conflict is almost absent; the scaffold scene in Chapter II contains no physical struggle, no raised voices (except the gossips), no dramatic confrontation. Instead, conflict exists as a sustained pressure between the individual conscience and communal judgment, between private feeling and public meaning. Hester's conflict with her society is rendered not through rebellion but through endurance: "she never responded to these attacks, save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly over her pale cheek, and again subsided into the depths of her bosom." The blush is the body's involuntary dissent from the will's imposed silence.

### Imagery
- **Sensory emphasis:** Visual and moral-visual. Hawthorne's prose is dominated by images of light and darkness, visibility and concealment, surface and depth. The scarlet letter is the supreme example: a visual object that is simultaneously a moral sign. Light in Hawthorne always means exposure -- "the sunshine, which, falling on all alike, seemed, to her sick and morbid heart, as if meant for no other purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast." Darkness means not evil but privacy, interiority, the hidden self. His famous moonlight passage in "The Custom-House" theorizes this explicitly: moonlight creates "a neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and fairy-land, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet." Tactile and olfactory imagery are rare; auditory imagery appears mainly as the murmur of crowds or the silence of isolation.
- **Metaphor frequency:** Moderate to high, but always in service of moral allegory rather than sensory vividness. Hawthorne's metaphors are not decorative; they are interpretive. Each one proposes a way of understanding a moral situation.
- **Metaphor style:** Three dominant metaphor fields:
  1. **Legal/penal:** "scaffold," "tribunal," "sentence," "doom," "brand," "penalty." Human life is a trial; sin is a crime; society is a court; the self is always on the dock.
  2. **Religious/spiritual:** "martyrdom," "penance," "saint-like," "purity," "redemption," "angels," "fiend." The Puritan theological framework is not merely setting but the grammar of Hawthorne's moral thought.
  3. **Alchemical/transformative:** Suffering transmutes the self. Hester's shame "might at length purge her soul, and work out another purity than that which she had lost; more saint-like, because the result of martyrdom." The scarlet letter itself undergoes alchemical transformation throughout the novel, changing its meaning as Hester changes.
  Extended metaphors and similes are frequent: the old General's character is "an old fortress, like Ticonderoga"; the Inspector is described through an extended animal metaphor; Hester is implicitly compared to the Virgin Mary "but only by contrast." These are not throwaway comparisons but sustained conceits that organize entire paragraphs.
- **Physical grounding:** Symbolic rather than realistic. The prison, the scaffold, the marketplace, Hester's cottage -- each is described with just enough physical detail to establish its moral significance. The cottage is "on the shore, looking across a basin of the sea at the forest-covered hills, towards the west" -- positioned between civilization and wilderness, sea and forest, the Puritan settlement and the unknown. The "clump of scrubby trees" that "did not so much conceal the cottage from view, as seem to denote that here was some object which would fain have been, or at least ought to be, concealed" is landscape performing moral commentary.

### Rhythm
- **Pacing:** Stately, processional, and deliberately slow. Hawthorne does not hurry. Chapter II covers perhaps twenty minutes of narrative time in over 300 lines; Chapter V covers months or years in similar space. The pacing is not governed by event but by reflection -- action occurs, then the narrator pauses to contemplate its meaning, to generalize from it, to relate it to the human condition at large. This makes the prose feel like it is always sinking deeper into its subject, boring toward some central truth that recedes as it is approached.
- **Paragraph length:** Long. Hawthorne's paragraphs frequently run 15-25 sentences and are essentially miniature essays, each with its own arc of observation, reflection, and conclusion. The paragraph describing Hester's exclusion from society (beginning "In this manner, Hester Prynne came to have a part to perform in the world") runs over 20 sentences and moves from her social position to her physical isolation to the psychological torment of every human gaze, building to an almost unbearable pitch of accumulated suffering. Short paragraphs are reserved for dialogue exchanges and dramatic moments: "Could it be true? She clutched the child so fiercely to her breast, that it sent forth a cry."
- **Dialogue balance:** Heavily weighted toward narration. Dialogue constitutes perhaps 10-15% of the novel chapters. When it appears, it is period-voiced and formal, often in Puritan diction: "Goodwives," "I trow not!" "Marry," "I warrant me." Dialogue functions as choral commentary (the gossips outside the prison) or dramatic crisis (Chillingworth's "Not thy soul... No, not thine!"), never as casual conversation. The Custom-House, by contrast, uses embedded quotation more freely but always within the narrator's controlling frame -- others' words are reported, paraphrased, and moralized upon.
- **Punctuation signature:** The **em-dash** is Hawthorne's signature punctuation mark. It performs three distinct functions: (1) interruption and parenthetical qualification: "the reader may smile,—but must not doubt my word,—"; (2) dramatic pause before revelation: "was that SCARLET LETTER, so fantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom"; (3) accumulation, building parallel clauses that amplify and darken: "at her, the child of honorable parents,—at her, the mother of a babe, that would hereafter be a woman,—at her, who had once been innocent,—as the figure, the body, the reality of sin." Semicolons serve as formal joinery within long sentences; commas create dense subordination. The effect is prose that breathes in long, heavy drafts -- never panting, never rushing, always building pressure.

## Voice Notes

What makes Hawthorne unmistakable is the **moral omniscience that refuses to judge.** His narrator sees into every heart, understands every motive, perceives the operations of sin and conscience with theological precision -- and yet continually withholds final verdict. "It is to be feared," "perchance," "possibly," "it may be" -- these qualifiers are not hedging but moral humility. Hawthorne writes as one who knows that human sin is real and that its consequences are devastating, but who also knows that the human capacity for judgment is itself a form of sin. The gossips who call for Hester's death are more damned by their righteousness than Hester is by her transgression. This double vision -- sin is real; judgment is dangerous -- is the engine of Hawthorne's entire moral universe.

The skilled mimic would focus first on this: **the narrator as moral philosopher.** Every scene, every image, every character description is simultaneously a particular observation and a general meditation. Hester standing on the scaffold is not merely Hester on the scaffold; she is a proposition about the nature of shame, the relationship between the individual and the community, the paradox of sin that ennobles even as it destroys. The narrative voice moves constantly between the concrete and the abstract, the historical and the timeless. A sentence about a specific morning in Puritan Boston will resolve into a statement about human nature itself: "In our nature, however, there is a provision, alike marvellous and merciful, that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture, but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it."

Second: **the symbolic imagination.** Hawthorne does not merely use symbols; he thinks symbolically. The scarlet letter, the scaffold, the prison door, the rosebush, the cottage on the margin, the forest -- these are not decorations applied to a realistic narrative but the primary units of meaning. Every physical detail in Hawthorne's prose is charged with moral significance. The sunshine that falls on Hester "seemed, to her sick and morbid heart, as if meant for no other purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast." Sunshine is not weather; it is exposure. Darkness is not nightfall; it is the hidden self. To write in Hawthorne's voice, you must think about what every object MEANS before you describe how it LOOKS.

Third: **the psychology of concealment.** Hawthorne's great subject is the hidden sin, the secret self, the gap between public appearance and private reality. The scarlet letter is the visible sin in a world of invisible ones. Hester's extraordinary power -- and the source of the novel's uncanny energy -- is that the letter gives her "a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts." She becomes a walking conscience, and the entire community's discomfort around her is the discomfort of people who fear being seen. This theme shapes every element of the prose: the narrator's own tentativeness about asserting what characters truly feel, the recurring imagery of veils and surfaces, the architecture of sentences that defer their meaning behind cascading qualifications.

Fourth: **temporal doubling.** Hawthorne always writes from two time periods at once. "The Custom-House" is the nineteenth century looking back at the seventeenth. The novel chapters are narrated with a consciousness of historical distance: "not less than two centuries ago," "in those dreary old times." This temporal doubling creates a distinctive tone -- part archaeological reconstruction, part moral archaeology. The narrator digs through the past not to recover facts but to uncover patterns of human nature that persist across centuries. The prose carries the weight of both periods simultaneously, and its deliberate archaism is a way of insisting that the past is not safely dead but actively haunting.

## Quick Reference

When writing in this voice:
- **Lead with moral reflection, not action.** Every scene should be preceded, accompanied, or followed by the narrator's contemplation of its meaning. Do not simply describe what happens; theorize about why it happens, what it reveals about human nature, and what interpretive frame best illuminates it. Use phrases like "it may seem marvellous," "there is a fatality," "in our nature there is a provision."
- **Build sentences with em-dashes and subordinate clauses.** The Hawthornean sentence delays its main clause, accumulates qualifications, interrupts itself with parenthetical asides, and resolves in a moral observation. Use dashes to create suspense within sentences. Stack prepositional phrases. Let the grammar enact the difficulty of moral understanding.
- **Make every physical detail symbolic.** Do not describe landscape, weather, architecture, or clothing for atmospheric effect alone. Each detail should carry allegorical weight. A house on the edge of town means social exile. Sunshine means exposure. A forest means moral wilderness. A needle means both art and penance. Name the symbolic resonance -- Hawthorne is not subtle about this; he tells the reader what things mean.
- **Maintain omniscient distance with sympathetic warmth.** The narrator is not inside the character but hovering just above, close enough to feel but far enough to philosophize. Use constructions like "she felt, at moments, as if," "possibly it was an instinctive device of her spirit," "it might be that another feeling kept her." These formulations respect the character's interiority while preserving the narrator's interpretive authority.
- **Qualify every judgment.** Never pronounce final moral verdict. Use "perhaps," "it may be," "it is to be feared," "perchance," "methinks," "not unfrequently." This is not indecision but moral seriousness -- the recognition that human motive is always mixed, always partly hidden even from the self.
- **Use the rhetoric of sermons and moral essays.** Hawthorne's prose draws on Puritan homiletic traditions even as it critiques Puritan morality. Employ generalizing pronouncements, allegorical set-pieces, exemplary narratives. Move freely between the specific instance and the universal principle.
- **Let darkness be a presence, not just an atmosphere.** Hawthorne's darkness is theological, not merely Gothic. Sin is real. Guilt is real. The consequences of transgression are borne in the body and the soul across generations. But mercy is also real, and it enters through the same channels as suffering -- through the wound that will not close, the mark that will not fade.

## Sample Passage

There are places, in every town of New England, where the past has not consented to be buried -- where it lingers, we might say, like an uneasy spirit denied the repose of the grave, pressing its cold countenance against the windowpanes of the present. Such a place was the Alderton house, standing at the northern extremity of the village, where the last paved street gave way to a rutted cartway, and thence to the mute and pathless wood. It had been the dwelling, some seven generations since, of a minister of severe repute, whose sermons -- so tradition whispered -- had possessed the singular faculty of driving his congregation not toward grace but toward despair; and whether it was this association, or the inherent gloom of the structure itself, with its small diamond-paned windows and its door of blackened oak, none of the village families had been willing to inhabit it for longer than a single winter, and some not even so long.

Into this house, on an October afternoon already darkening toward the early dusk of the season, came Patience Alderton, to take up the burden -- for surely it may be called nothing lighter -- of her inheritance. She was the last of the name; and it is a truth, though one which the proud and the fortunate may dispute, that the final inheritor of a long lineage feels less the honor of descent than the accumulated weight of all those vanished lives, pressing upon the spirit like so many layers of earth upon a coffin. She stood in the entryway, where the chill struck upward through the flagstones, and perceived -- with that mingling of recognition and estrangement which attends our return to places known only in childhood -- that the house had been waiting for her. The dust lay undisturbed upon the stair-rail. A dry leaf, blown in through some unguarded crevice, rested upon the hearthstone as if it had been placed there with deliberate care. And on the mantle, in a frame of tarnished silver, there hung the likeness of the Reverend Alderton himself -- that terrible ancestor -- regarding his descendant with eyes in which, it seemed to Patience, severity and sorrow were so intermingled as to be indistinguishable.

She did not flinch from his gaze. It may be -- for who can speak with certainty of the movements of a human soul at such a moment? -- that she felt, beneath her dread, something not altogether unlike kinship. The sins of the fathers are visited upon the children, so the Scripture tells us; but perhaps it is equally true that the children, standing at last in the places where those sins were committed, come to understand -- not to forgive, not to condemn, but merely to understand -- that sin and sorrow are the common inheritance of all who draw breath, and that the house which shelters us is built, beam by beam, from the accumulated griefs of those who sheltered here before.
