**Translation note:** This profile is based on Garnett's English rendering. Structural patterns (sentence architecture, paragraph rhythms, narrative techniques, POV management, character-revelation methods) survive translation reliably. Word-level choices -- specific adjective selection, idiomatic phrasing, register calibration -- reflect Garnett's Victorian-Edwardian idiom as much as Tolstoy's Russian. The profile marks Garnett-specific features where they can be distinguished from Tolstoy's SIGNATURE patterns.

## Style Characteristics

### Sentence Structure
- **Average length:** Highly variable, ranging from 6-word declarations to 80+ word compound-complex constructions. Narrative paragraphs average 30-45 words per sentence, but the range within a single paragraph can be enormous. Short declarative sentences punctuate longer analytical ones, creating a rhythm of expansion and contraction.
- **Variation:** Purposeful and psychologically motivated. When Tolstoy is analyzing a character's moral position, sentences lengthen and accumulate subordinate clauses. When a character acts, sentences shorten and become kinetic. Dialogue sentences are typically short and natural-sounding. The shift from long analytical narration to short physical action is itself a SIGNATURE rhythm.
- **Dominant patterns:** The "character assessment" -- a sustained paragraph-length analysis of a character's nature, habits, or moral position, built from stacked clauses connected by semicolons and "and." The "physical catalogue" -- a sequence of concrete actions joined by commas and "and," creating a sense of continuous, flowing physical reality: "he put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied the tassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air into his broad, bare chest, he walked to the window." The "philosophical generalization" -- a sentence that lifts from the specific to the universal, often beginning with an impersonal construction: "There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful."
- **Signature moves:**
  - **The aphoristic opening:** A sweeping, seemingly simple declaration that carries immense philosophical weight and announces the entire moral architecture of what follows. "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This is SIGNATURE Tolstoy -- the essay-like pronouncement that drops into the narrative like a stone into water. These aphorisms are never ironic; they are meant with full moral seriousness.
  - **The self-contradicting qualification:** A character's self-assessment is rendered faithfully, then quietly undermined by its own logic. "All he repented of was that he had not succeeded better in hiding it from his wife." The sentence does not comment on the moral absurdity; it presents the character's reasoning as he experiences it, and the contradiction speaks for itself. This is SIGNATURE -- the narrator does not need to editorialize because the character's own thought contains its own judgment.
  - **The parenthetical intrusion of thought into action:** A character is doing something physical, and in the middle of it, a thought breaks through, contained in parentheses or dashes: "his face utterly involuntarily (reflex spinal action, reflected Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of physiology)--utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual, good-humored, and therefore idiotic smile." The parenthetical reveals character: Stiva reaches for a scientific term even in crisis, because he is that kind of man.
  - **The telescoping "but":** A sentence builds toward one conclusion and then pivots sharply: "He was conscious that he loved the boy less, and always tried to be fair; but the boy felt it, and did not respond with a smile to his father's chilly smile." The "but" does not merely reverse; it deepens, bringing a second consciousness into collision with the first.
  - **The universal generalization grounded in the specific:** "There was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to all questions, even the most complex and insoluble. That answer is: one must live in the needs of the day--that is, forget oneself." Tolstoy moves from a specific character's specific crisis to a law of human existence, and the transition is seamless because he genuinely believes in such laws.
  - **The cascade of negatives:** "He had only not to refuse things, not to show jealousy, not to be quarrelsome or take offense, all of which from his characteristic good nature he never did." A character is defined not by what he does but by what he does not do, and the accumulation of negatives reveals the passivity at his core.

### Word Choice
- **Register:** Plain, direct, and deliberately unliterary. Tolstoy (through Garnett) favors common words over elevated ones. Characters "feel," "think," "say," "look" -- not "perceive," "reflect," "declare," "gaze." Abstract moral vocabulary is deployed freely but without ornamentation: "fault," "forgive," "blame," "love," "hate," "pity," "conscience," "truth." This plainness is SIGNATURE -- Tolstoy distrusted literary language and aimed for the transparent clarity of ordinary speech applied to extraordinary depths of feeling.
- **Specificity:** Highly specific about physical objects, bodily sensations, and material circumstances. Stiva's slippers are "a present on his last birthday, worked for him by his wife on gold-colored morocco." The barber cuts "a pink path through his long, curly whiskers." Levin notices Grinevitch's "long white fingers, such long yellow filbert-shaped nails, and such huge shining studs on the shirt-cuff." This is SIGNATURE: moral and psychological truths are anchored in physical particulars. The concrete detail is never decorative; it always reveals character or condition.
- **Vocabulary range:** Moderate in individual word choice but vast in the range of experience it covers. In ten chapters, the vocabulary moves seamlessly from dream imagery to bureaucratic procedure, from marital agony to ice-skating, from philosophical argument to restaurant menus. The genius is not in rare words but in the range of human experience brought under a single, unified narrative voice.
- **Signature vocabulary:** "Conscious" and "consciousness" (used constantly -- characters are always "conscious of" their feelings, faults, positions). "Position" (social, moral, emotional -- characters are always aware of their "position"). "Characteristic" (deployed as both adjective and explanation -- behaviors are rendered as typical of the person, implying deep knowledge of them). "Good-humored" / "good-humoredly" (a key Garnett-Tolstoy word, applied especially to Stiva). "Reflected" and "recalled" (the vocabulary of memory and self-assessment). "Obviously," "evidently," "apparently" (the narrator's tools for indicating that psychological states are readable from the outside). GARNETT-SPECIFIC: "to be sure," "all at once," "at once," "in spite of," "as it were," "for all that," "could not help" -- these connective phrases are Garnett's characteristic joinery and appear on nearly every page.
- **Avoids:** Metaphorical extravagance, purple prose, writerly self-consciousness, clever turns of phrase, verbal pyrotechnics. Tolstoy does not reach for the striking word; he reaches for the true one. Also avoids ironic distance -- unlike Austen, Tolstoy never winks at the reader. His narrator may see more than the character, but the narrator's tone is compassionate, not sardonic.

### Tone
- **Emotional temperature:** Warm to hot. This is the fundamental difference from Austen and most English-language realists. Tolstoy's narrative voice radiates moral warmth even when analyzing characters critically. Stiva is a shallow, unfaithful man, but the narration of his morning -- his dream, his slippers, his children -- is suffused with a tenderness that does not excuse him but refuses to reduce him. Dolly's pain is rendered with almost unbearable directness: "her lips stiffened again, and again the muscles of her right cheek worked." The strongest emotions are not deflected or sublimated; they are met head-on, though always through physical manifestation rather than abstract declaration.
- **Narrative distance:** Fluid and masterful, but different from Austen's ironic sliding. Tolstoy's narrator moves between three positions: (1) the panoramic overview, which sees characters from the outside and assesses their position in society and moral space; (2) deep interior access, which enters a character's consciousness so fully that the narrator's voice and the character's thoughts become indistinguishable; (3) the philosophical elevation, where the narrator rises above both character and scene to state a general truth about human nature. These shifts often occur within a single paragraph. SIGNATURE: Tolstoy achieves a quality of intimacy that feels almost physiological -- we are inside the character's body, feeling their blush, their catch of breath, the lump in their throat.
  - **Example of the shift:** "It appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget--his wife." First, exterior observation (he checked his belongings); then, a pivot to interior knowledge (the thing he wanted to forget); then, a moral verdict delivered as simple fact (--his wife). Three levels of access in one sentence.
- **Humor:** Present but never dominant, and never ironic in the Austenian sense. Tolstoy's humor is observational and character-driven: Stiva remembering his joke about the German watchmaker immediately after a devastating marital scene; the Tatar waiter reciting the French menu to himself after Stiva deliberately orders in Russian; Levin blurting out his feelings and then being "horror-stricken at his own words." The humor arises from the incongruity of human nature -- people cannot help being themselves, even in crisis. Tolstoy does not make fun of his characters; he observes their absurdity with something close to love.
- **Conflict rendering:** Direct, embodied, and painful. Tolstoy does not filter conflict through social decorum (as Austen does) or theatrical set-pieces (as Dickens does). The Dolly-Stiva confrontation in Chapter 4 is rendered through physical detail -- her cheek muscles contracting, his face relaxing, her clinging to the chair back -- and through direct speech that is raw, repetitive, and emotionally true: "Go away, go away, go away!" The rawness is SIGNATURE. Characters in Tolstoy do not speak polished dialogue in moments of crisis; they repeat themselves, stammer, break off, and say things they immediately regret.

### Imagery
- **Sensory emphasis:** Heavily visual and tactile -- a marked contrast with Austen's near-total sensory absence. Tolstoy's world is physically real: leather sofas, springy cushions, serge curtains, the smell of scent from whiskers, the pink path of a razor through curly hair, the "starchy napkin" tucked into a waistcoat, the "mother-of-pearl shells" of oysters. Physical sensations are the medium through which emotional states are communicated. Levin's love for Kitty is rendered through his "throbbing heart," his breathlessness, his blushing "not as grown men blush, slightly, without being themselves aware of it, but as boys blush." The body is always present in Tolstoy; consciousness is always embodied.
- **Metaphor frequency:** Low but powerful when it appears. Tolstoy generally prefers literal description to figurative language. When metaphor does surface, it tends to be drawn from the natural or domestic world and carries strong emotional charge: Kitty is "as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles"; she is like "the sun" to Levin, and when her expression changes, it is "like the sun going behind a cloud." The sun/light metaphor for the beloved is PERIOD (common in 19th-century fiction) but Tolstoy deploys it with characteristic directness -- not as ornament but as the accurate rendering of how a man in love actually perceives. The simile of political views being chosen "just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat, but simply took those that were being worn" is more characteristic -- homely, domestic, deflating.
- **Metaphor style:** Domestic and bodily. Stiva's morning newspaper creates "the slight fog it diffused in his brain" (thought as weather). Matvey holds up the shirt "like a horse's collar" (dressing as harnessing). The Frenchwoman at the restaurant is "all made up, it seemed, of false hair, poudre de riz, and vinaigre de toilette" (a person reduced to her materials). When Tolstoy reaches for a figure, it comes from the material world his characters inhabit, not from literary tradition.
- **Physical grounding:** Intense and always significant. Rooms are not merely named but furnished: the leather-covered sofa, the serge curtains, the looking-glass, the gold-colored morocco slippers. Bodies are not merely present but active: Stiva's "stout, well-cared-for person," his "broad, bare chest," his feet that "carried his full frame so easily." Levin's "strongly built, broad-shouldered" frame, his "curly beard," his "sheepskin cap." Physical descriptions always carry moral or psychological information. Stiva's body broadcasts ease and pleasure; Levin's broadcasts vigor and discomfort in civilized spaces. The skating scene in Chapter 9 is Tolstoy's most sustained physical set-piece in these chapters: ice, snow, the clank of chains, the rumble of sledges, Kitty's "slender feet in their high boots," the boy "desperately waving his arms and bowed down to the ground." The world is palpably, concretely there.

### Rhythm
- **Pacing:** Controlled by an alternation between three modes: (1) analytical narration, which moves slowly through a character's psychology, accumulating understanding; (2) scenic action, which moves at the pace of real time, rendered through dialogue and physical detail; (3) temporal compression, which leaps across years or months in a few sentences. The rhythm of these alternations is SIGNATURE. Chapter 3 opens with a compressed morning routine (scenic), expands into a long analytical passage about Stiva's political opinions (analytical), returns to scenic mode for the children's visit, and ends with another compressed sequence (the petitioner, the departure). This three-stroke rhythm -- scene, analysis, compression -- is the engine of Tolstoy's narrative.
- **Paragraph length:** Highly variable. Analytical paragraphs can run 15-20 sentences, building a complete portrait of a character's moral position (the liberalism passage in Chapter 3; Levin's self-doubt in Chapter 6). Dialogue paragraphs are often a single speech plus a brief narrative tag. The longest paragraphs are character assessments; the shortest are moments of physical action or emotional crisis. The contrast in paragraph length creates visual rhythm on the page and signals shifts in narrative mode.
- **Dialogue balance:** Dialogue constitutes roughly 30-40% of these chapters, but its distribution is uneven. Chapters 1-3 are largely narration with embedded dialogue; Chapter 4 is heavily dialogic (the Stiva-Dolly confrontation); Chapter 5 mixes dialogue and narration; Chapters 7-8 are dialogue-heavy (the philosophical debate, the brothers' conversation); Chapter 9 blends dialogue with intensely rendered physical action; Chapter 10 is almost entirely dialogue (the restaurant scene). SIGNATURE: Tolstoy's dialogue is naturalistic to a degree unusual in 19th-century fiction. Characters interrupt each other, trail off, repeat themselves, say "Eh?" and "Oh!" and "Well." Stiva's "Ah, ah, ah! Oo!..." and Levin's "I? I've not long ... yesterday ... I mean today ... I arrived" are characteristic. Dialogue tags are simple ("he said," "she cried," "he repeated") but often accompanied by a physical detail that does the real expressive work: "said Levin, looking with hatred at Grinevitch's hand."
- **Punctuation signature:** Semicolons for joining parallel or contrasting clauses within analytical sentences. Em-dashes for three distinct purposes: (1) parenthetical insertions of thought or qualification ("Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world--"); (2) dramatic interruption in dialogue ("One thing: forgive.... Remember, cannot nine years of my life atone for an instant...."); (3) the moral pivot or revelation ("It appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget--his wife"). Ellipses in dialogue to indicate trailing off, hesitation, or emotional overwhelm. GARNETT-SPECIFIC: heavy use of "and" as sentence-opener and clause-connector, creating a cumulative, additive rhythm that may exaggerate Tolstoy's characteristic parataxis.

## Voice Notes

What makes Tolstoy unmistakable -- even in translation -- is the **moral seriousness combined with radical intimacy**. At any moment, the narrator is simultaneously doing two things: inhabiting a character's consciousness with near-physiological completeness, and assessing that character's moral position with total clarity. But unlike Austen's ironic double vision, Tolstoy's assessment is never detached. The narrator who sees Stiva's shallowness also sees his genuine charm, his real affection for his children, his helpless inability to be other than what he is. The narrator who enters Dolly's anguish does not sentimentalize it but renders it through the working of her cheek muscles and the slamming of a bureau drawer. This combination -- seeing through and yet feeling with -- is the core of the Tolstoyan voice.

The skilled mimic would focus first on this: **every character is understood from the inside and judged from the outside, and these two operations happen simultaneously.** Stiva thinks "it's all my fault--all my fault, though I'm not to blame," and the narrator presents this thought without comment, because the thought itself contains both the character's self-knowledge and his moral limitation. The gap between what the character genuinely feels and what he cannot see is not pointed out; it is simply rendered. The reader does the judging. This is different from Austen's irony (which guides the reader's judgment through syntactic signals) and from Dostoevsky's intensity (which inhabits the character so completely that external judgment becomes impossible). Tolstoy holds both positions at once.

Second: **the body as the medium of consciousness.** Characters in Tolstoy do not merely think and speak; they blush, tremble, sigh, square their chests, knit their brows, feel lumps in their throats. These are not decorative physical details; they are the actual substance of psychological experience. When Levin blushes "not as grown men blush, slightly, without being themselves aware of it, but as boys blush, feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness, and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more, almost to the point of tears," the physical description IS the psychological analysis. There is no separation between body and mind. To write in Tolstoy's voice, you must render thought as a physical event.

Third: **the panoramic scope within the intimate scene.** Even in the most personal moments -- Stiva waking up, Dolly confronting her husband, Levin seeing Kitty on the ice -- the narration reaches outward to encompass the social world. Stiva is not just a man who has been unfaithful; he is a man whose political opinions come to him "just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat." Levin is not just a man in love; he is a man who sees the world divided into "she alone, having no weaknesses of any sort and higher than all humanity" and "all the girls in the world except her." The individual psychology is always embedded in a social and philosophical context. The scale is always larger than the moment.

Fourth: **the refusal of irony in favor of compassion.** Tolstoy's narrator is never above the characters. The narrator understands them more fully than they understand themselves, but the tone is never superior. When Stiva, moments after his wife has called him a scoundrel, remembers his joke about the German watchmaker and thinks "maybe she will come round! That's a good expression, 'come round,'" the narrator does not mock him. The observation is precise, devastating, and affectionate all at once. This is the hardest thing to imitate: genuine moral seriousness without moral contempt.

Fifth: **the essay-voice that erupts within the narrative.** Tolstoy does not merely tell a story; he thinks about it. The passage on Stiva's liberalism (Chapter 3) is a miniature essay on the sociology of political opinion, embedded within the morning routine of a man eating breakfast. The passage on Levin's love (Chapter 6) is a meditation on the psychology of idealization. These digressions do not feel like interruptions because they are generated by the same narrative intelligence that renders the physical details. The hat-and-coat simile for political views is as concrete as the description of Stiva's slippers. Thought and observation are one.

## Quick Reference

When writing in this voice:
- **Ground everything in physical reality.** Characters have bodies, and their bodies express their inner states. Describe what they do with their hands, how they stand, what their faces do. A "catch in his breath and a lump in his throat" tells us more than "he was moved."
- **Enter the character's consciousness fully, then let the reader judge.** Present thoughts as the character experiences them, including their self-justifications and blind spots. Do not editorialize. If a character thinks something morally absurd, render the absurdity faithfully; the reader will see it. "All he repented of was that he had not succeeded better in hiding it from his wife" needs no authorial comment.
- **Use plain, direct language.** Avoid literary flourishes, clever phrasings, or self-conscious prose. Prefer "said" to "declared," "thought" to "reflected" (though Garnett uses "reflected" freely), "felt" to "sensed." The power comes from what is said, not how it is decorated.
- **Alternate between close-up and panoramic.** After entering a character's private thoughts, pull back to show how they appear to others, or how their private situation connects to larger social patterns. After a general observation about human nature, drop into a specific, concrete detail.
- **Let dialogue be naturalistic and imperfect.** Characters interrupt, repeat themselves, trail off, say "Eh?" and "Well." They do not deliver polished speeches. In crisis, they say the same thing three different ways: "Go away, go away, go away!" In conversation, they veer between the topic at hand and what is really on their minds.
- **Include the physical world.** Name specific objects: the mother-of-pearl ashtray, the gold-colored morocco slippers, the filbert-shaped nails. These are not decorations; they are the texture of reality that makes the psychological analysis feel grounded and true.
- **Make transitions between characters feel natural but deliberate.** Tolstoy shifts POV between chapters and sometimes within them, but always with clear motivation. We leave Stiva and enter Dolly when we need to see the crisis from the other side. We leave the domestic sphere for the office when the character does.
- **Use the body to reveal what dialogue conceals.** When Dolly says "What do you want?" in "a rapid, deep, unnatural voice," the voice tells us everything her words do not. When Stiva tries "to look pitiful and humble, but for all that he was radiant with freshness and health," the body betrays the performance.
- **Allow philosophical reflection to emerge from domestic detail.** The best Tolstoyan digressions feel inevitable -- they grow from the specific scene into the general truth and then return to the scene. They are never purely abstract; they are anchored in the physical and social world of the characters.
- **Approach characters with moral seriousness and without contempt.** Even the weakest characters (Stiva's shallowness, Levin's social awkwardness) are rendered with understanding. The narrator knows what is wrong with them and also knows why they cannot help it.

## Sample Passage

Pyotr Ivanovich had been meaning for three weeks to speak to his wife about the matter of the Volkonsky property, and for three weeks he had not spoken, not because the occasion had not presented itself -- it had presented itself daily, at breakfast, at dinner, and in the evenings when they sat together in the drawing room -- but because each time he was on the point of beginning, he was seized by the conviction that this was not the right moment, that she was tired, or preoccupied, or in too cheerful a humor to be disturbed. And so the days had passed, and the letter from the lawyer lay in his desk drawer, under a volume of Schiller that he had not opened in four years.

On Wednesday morning, however, something changed. He came down to breakfast and found his wife already seated, not reading the newspaper that lay folded beside her plate, but sitting with her hands in her lap, looking at him with an expression he had seen before but could not at once place. She was pale, and the small crease between her eyebrows, which appeared only when she was thinking about something painful, was visible.

"Good morning," he said, and kissed the top of her head.

She did not answer at once. Then: "Sit down, Petya. I want to ask you something."

He sat down, and reached for the coffeepot, and poured himself a cup, though he was not thirsty, and then set the cup down without drinking. He was conscious that his hand had been perfectly steady, and this seemed to him, for some reason, contemptible.

"They told me yesterday," she began, and stopped. She picked up the newspaper and set it down again. "Liza Arkadyevna told me yesterday that the Volkonsky estate is already being divided, that Sergei Nikolaitch has engaged a surveyor."

He looked at her. So she knew. And at the same moment it came to him with perfect clarity that he had not been waiting for the right moment to tell her; he had been waiting for her to find out from someone else, so that he would not have to watch her face as she learned it. He could not forgive himself this, and yet he could see, as clearly as he saw the steam rising from his untouched coffee, that he would have done the same thing again.

"Yes," he said. "I meant to tell you."

"When?" she said. Not angrily -- that would have been easier -- but with a quiet bewilderment, as though she genuinely wanted to understand. And this was the worst of it: her willingness to understand, her patience, which he did not deserve and which made him feel, as he always felt in such moments, that she was the better person, and that this knowledge, instead of making him grateful, made him obscurely resentful.

He drank his coffee. It had gone cold.
