## Style Characteristics

### Sentence Structure
Doyle favors a clean, forward-moving prose built on compound sentences joined by commas and conjunctions. His narrative sentences run 20-40 words on average, long enough to carry detail but never labyrinthine. The dominant pattern is declarative: subject-verb-object, often extended with a participial phrase or appositional detail that adds one precise observation. Dialogue sentences are shorter and clipped, frequently under ten words, creating a brisk volley between speakers. A signature move is the rapid-fire exchange where each line is a single sentence of 1-5 words, building momentum through compression rather than elaboration. Another is the scene-setting opener that anchors a passage in time, date, and circumstance before anything else happens.

### Word Choice
The register is educated but accessible -- Victorian professional-class English. Doyle prefers concrete, specific nouns (brougham, gasogene, ulster, astrakhan) over abstract ones, and his adjectives tend toward the precisely descriptive rather than the emotional: "florid-faced," "stout," "broad-brimmed." Technical and professional vocabulary appears naturally -- medical terms from Watson, legal and chemical terms from Holmes -- without pedantry. The prose avoids ornamental Latinate excess; where Doyle reaches for a longer word, it earns its place through exactness. Signature terms include "singular," "remarkable," "endeavour," "precisely," "humdrum," and "trifling."

### Tone
Measured, companionable, and fundamentally rational. Watson narrates with the steady warmth of a trusted friend recounting events to an interested listener. There is dry humor but no comedy; admiration but no sentimentality. The emotional register stays between mild unease and restrained excitement, with rare moments of genuine alarm rendered all the more effective by the surrounding composure. Holmes's dialogue provides a cooler, more sardonic counterpoint, but even at his most cutting, the tone remains civil. The overall effect is one of gentlemanly reliability -- a voice you trust precisely because it does not overstate.

### Imagery
Visual and concrete, delivered through the eye of a trained observer. Physical descriptions catalog telling details in sequence: clothing, posture, hands, complexion. Settings are sketched efficiently -- a few specific objects (an armchair, a gasogene, a bell-pull) stand in for the whole room. Metaphors are rare and functional; when they appear, they tend toward the mechanical or scientific (a mind compared to an instrument, emotion to grit in a lens). Sensory detail beyond the visual is sparse but effective: the sound of hooves on cobblestones, the smell of iodoform. The imagery serves deduction, not atmosphere -- every described detail is potentially a clue.

### Rhythm
The pacing alternates between two modes: deliberate narration (Watson describing scenes, summarizing time) and rapid dialogue (the back-and-forth exchanges that drive deductive sequences). Transitions between these modes are smooth and frequent, giving the prose a varied, readable pulse. Paragraphs of narration tend to run 4-8 sentences; dialogue can run for pages in staccato exchanges. The overall rhythm is that of the case itself -- slow assembly of facts, mounting puzzlement, then the sudden acceleration of revelation. Doyle closes stories and scenes with brief, declarative summations that land with quiet authority.

## Voice Notes

Doyle's genius is accessibility in service of complexity. Watson is the reader's surrogate -- intelligent but not brilliant, observant but not deductive, warm but not sentimental. The prose never shows off; it assembles details with the patience of a doctor taking a case history, then lets Holmes's deductions reframe everything the reader has already seen. The pleasure of the voice is the pleasure of competence: every sentence does its job and moves on.

The interplay between Watson's narration and Holmes's dialogue is the engine of the style. Watson provides the steady, reliable frame; Holmes provides the intellectual fireworks. When writing in this voice, resist the temptation to let the narrator become too clever. Watson's mild bafflement is structural -- it creates the space for revelation. His descriptions should be thorough, honest, and just slightly behind the curve of the mystery.

What makes Doyle unmistakable is the combination of Victorian formality with narrative efficiency. There is no wasted motion. A character enters, is described in one precise paragraph of physical detail, speaks, and the story advances. The prose trusts its reader to keep up and rewards that trust with clarity.

## Quick Reference

- **Anchor in time and place.** Open scenes with a specific date, time of day, or circumstance: "One night -- it was on the twentieth of March, 1888 -- I was returning from a journey to a patient."
- **Describe people through clothing and physical tells.** Catalog outward details that imply biography: worn cuffs, ink-stained fingers, a too-large right hand. Let observation do the work of exposition.
- **Keep dialogue clipped and purposeful.** Exchanges should move quickly, with short speeches and minimal dialogue tags. Use "said" and "remarked" more than anything else.
- **Maintain Watson's register: educated, honest, slightly behind.** The narrator notices everything but understands only part of it. He is never foolish, but he is reliably surprised by the solution.
- **Use compound sentences, not complex nests.** Join clauses with "and," "but," "while," and "for" rather than stacking subordinate clauses. The prose should feel like clear forward motion, not labyrinthine descent.
- **Deploy dry understatement for humor.** Comedy comes from restraint -- a "trifling" matter that is anything but, a "singular" event that is extraordinary. Never reach for a laugh; let irony do the work.
- **Close with quiet authority.** End scenes and stories with a brief, measured summary that places events in perspective without overexplaining.

## Sample Passage

I had not seen Hargrove in some weeks, and it was with a certain surprise that I found his card upon the hall table when I returned from my morning walk. The day was fine -- one of those rare November mornings when the London fog relents and permits a thin, watery sunlight to reach the pavement -- and I had taken the longer route through the park, so that it was nearly eleven before I let myself in.

Mrs. Calloway informed me that the gentleman had called at half past nine and had waited above an hour before departing. He had left no message beyond the card itself, though she noted that he had seemed, in her words, "rather put out about something." I turned the card over in my fingers. It was a perfectly ordinary visiting card, cream-coloured, with his name and club address printed in a modest type. There was nothing remarkable about it whatever -- and yet I found myself returning to it throughout the afternoon, troubled by a detail I could not quite identify.

It was not until I sat down to my tea that the thing struck me. The card was new -- crisp-edged, unhandled, fresh from the printer. But Hargrove had given up his membership at the Dorian Club the previous spring. I had been present when he announced it. The address on the card was for a club to which he no longer belonged, printed on stock that could not have been more than a fortnight old. It was a small thing, perhaps a trifling thing, but I have learned over the years that it is precisely the trifling things which repay the closest attention.
