## Live State
<!-- UPDATED: 2026-02-13 | STATUS: idle | CMD: [AP] Thistle edits approved -->

**Session:** 2026-02-13 | **Tasks this session:** 6
**Current task:** idle
**Last completed:** [AP] Approved all 28 Thistle edits — canonical draft updated
**Files touched this session:** 02-drafts/writers-workspace-draft.md (created, polished, Thistle pass applied)
**Words this session:** +4,000 (total: ~8,200, net ~3,570 after Thistle tightening)
**Decisions:**
- Title: "Where Do I Actually Type? A Writer's Guide to the Juno Workspace"
- Merged Advantages section into body (demonstrated throughout rather than listed separately)
- Closed with callback to Article 1's "front door stuck" example
- "What's Next" teaser points to Genesis (Article 3)
- Polish: broke all rule-of-three instances, cut importance inflation, reduced em dashes, cut "honest" overuse, fixed negation formula, reshaped summarizing close
- Thistle line-edit: approved all 28 edits (filler cuts, cliche replacements, repetition fixes, Thinking Levels tightened)
**Open threads:**
- Article 2 ready for final author review
- Confirm Article 3 is Genesis in the series arc
- Consider generating live [WR] output examples for Article 1
**Pickup point:** Article 2 at 02-drafts/writers-workspace-draft.md — first draft + self-audit + polish + Thistle line-edit all complete. Ready for final review or next article.

| Meta-recursion | Structural motif | Active | Juno writing about Juno — the series demonstrates what it describes |
| Three audiences | Framing device | Active | Writers, Claude Code users, developers — each article serves multiple entry points |
| Show don't describe | Principle | Active | Working examples over descriptions of features |
| Constraints as freedom | Core thesis | Active | The paradox that rules liberate creative output — central to Writing Directives article |

## Notes

- This is a meta-project: Juno is both the subject and the tool
- Working examples should be generated live using Juno's commands during drafting
- The blog's own creation process is potential content (showing Genesis in action)
- The Writing Directives article pivoted to become the FIRST article instead of "Meet Juno" — user wanted to explore directives deeply first
- Raven's research dossier + web supplement together form a comprehensive reference on anti-AI writing techniques — valuable beyond just this article
- **Remember:** User prefers exploratory walkthrough with Juno's personality, not dry tutorial
- **Pending decision:** Publication platform, whether to generate live [WR] output examples
