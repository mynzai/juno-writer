## Notes

- This is a meta-project: Juno is both the subject and the tool
- Working examples should be generated live using Juno's commands during drafting
- The blog's own creation process is potential content (showing Genesis in action)
- The Writing Directives article pivoted to become the FIRST article instead of "Meet Juno" — user wanted to explore directives deeply first
- Raven's research dossier + web supplement together form a comprehensive reference on anti-AI writing techniques — valuable beyond just this article
- **Remember:** User prefers exploratory walkthrough with Juno's personality, not dry tutorial
- **Pending decision:** Publication platform, whether to generate live [WR] output examples
