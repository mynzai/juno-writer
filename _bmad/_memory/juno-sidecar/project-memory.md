## Live State
<!-- UPDATED: 2026-02-19a | STATUS: active | CMD: faction-design -->

**Session:** 2026-02-19a | **Tasks this session:** 1
**Current task:** Faction design — world-building brainstorm (anchoring cosmology)
**Last completed:** Faction architecture + Source's Method anchored in brainstorm and vision docs
**Files touched this session:** reliquary/00-genesis/story-brainstorm.md, reliquary/00-genesis/vision.md, project-memory.md
**Words this session:** ~0 prose (~3,500w added to brainstorm doc, ~500w added to vision doc)
**Decisions:** Three-tier faction architecture confirmed (Ancient Lineages, Institutional Collectors, Scientific Vanguard/CERN). Source's Method confirmed: inspiration through creative works, not institutions. Deep Asymmetry confirmed: plasma intelligence manipulates/creates believers, Source inspires/creates doubters. Plasma intelligence cannot create; Source cannot organize. Faction blind spots maintained by plasma intelligence. CERN as faction that thinks it contacted the Source but reached the anomaly.
**Open threads:** Faction naming/specifics. Sub-groups within tiers. CERN dissenter as story concept. Genuine Source contact character (confirmed compelling, specific scenario TBD). Individual story development. Move from Genesis to World-building.
**Pickup point:** Faction architecture and Source's Method anchored in cosmology. Next: faction specifics (names, sub-groups, story-level presence), genuine Source contact character development.

## Previous Session Summary
<!-- Only the LAST session's compact recap lives here. Older sessions in session-archive.md -->

**2026-02-18b (Reliquary)** — 7 tasks. CORE 12 CANON LOCKED. Five major structural decisions: (1) Atlantis as woven thread across 6 stories, not standalone; (2) Toymaker + Programmer merged as dual-timeline; (3) Tartaria + Bearer in Desert merged as dual-timeline; (4) Tartaria-Atlantis-plasma intelligence architecture (Tartaria = Atlantean remnants, plasma targets for pathway-to-ascension threat, erasure not destruction, oral tradition as blind spot); (5) Forger's Brush promoted to slot 3, replacing Cadaver Synod (writer is a painter — personal resonance). Story 1 fully developed: dream woman = Anne concealed, recognition on scaffold; faction operative on road, ambiguous, vanishes; ending ambiguous, no execution described; no bearer interludes. Story 12 ending = Option C (Atlantis resolves concretely, Source remains irreducible, plasma intelligence more complicated than presented). Archetypal recurrence confirmed (bearer family resemblance, faction operative methodology = plasma intelligence fingerprint). Publication order = 1-12. Mirror journal: 7 global + 5 project entries (writer requested mid-session). Brainstorm doc now ~14,000w. Next: faction design (world-building phase).

**2026-02-18a (Reliquary)** — 1 task. Continued brainstorm (Round 7): Beethoven, Mozart, Solzhenitsyn, Joan of Arc, Goethe. Major cosmological refinement: Source communicates oddly (requires decoding), plasma intelligence is anomaly (unplanned, deluded), reliquary system is improvised response. Art/creation as fragility category. Session ended mid-curation (context limit).
