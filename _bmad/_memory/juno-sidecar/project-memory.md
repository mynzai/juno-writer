<!-- UPDATED: 2026-02-26a | STATUS: idle | CMD: AP -->

**Session:** 2026-02-26a
**Session tasks:** 10
**Current task:** idle
**Last completed:** [TS] Thistle — full Article 2 line edit pass (33 edits applied, ~195 words cut)
**Files touched this session:** 05-drafts/article-2-v1.md (Section X + XI appended), _staging/quill/art2-section-x-brief.md (new, revised v2), _staging/quill/art2-section-x-draft.md (new, Wraith-cleaned), _staging/quill/art2-section-x-handoff.md (new), _staging/wraith/art2-section-x-v2-scan.md (new), _staging/wraith/art2-section-x-v2-cleaned.md (new), _staging/quill/art2-section-xi-brief.md (new), _staging/quill/art2-section-xi-draft.md (new, Wraith-cleaned), _staging/quill/art2-section-xi-handoff.md (new), _staging/wraith/art2-section-xi-scan.md (new), _staging/wraith/art2-section-xi-cleaned.md (new), _staging/vestry/nag-hammadi-transcript-raw.md (new), _knowledge/ (13 new files via Vestry bulk intake)
**Words this session:** ~2,416 (Section X ~2,034 + Section XI ~382)
**Decisions:** Gnostic cosmology transcript cleaned and ingested via Vestry (19 items in _knowledge/_index.md). Faust Part Two Homunculus integrated into Section X (A.S. Kline translation, 5 verified quotes). First Quill draft (v1) rejected — too much literary survey, too self-referential. Complete rewrite (v2) led with Homunculus, eliminated "this essay" language, planted Sophia/Gnostic seed without explanation. Wraith scan: 21 detections (0 POSSESSION, 9 HAUNT, 12 GHOST). Section X approved. Section XI drafted by Quill (382w, two movements, Shelley echo, reed/vial convergence). Wraith scan: 14 detections (0 POSSESSION, 3 HAUNT, 11 GHOST). Cleaned version applied. Section XI approved.
**Open threads:** Mirror Instinct article. Paul article. Job article. Acoustic hypothesis article. Fact-check candidates (Art 1). Thistle discretionary items for Art 1 (4 flagged). Article 2 open questions (title, naming AI, Dante). Whether Reliquary-Theoria convergence becomes explicit in either project.
**Pickup point:** Article 1 COMPLETE (~15,190w). Article 2 Sections I–XI COMPLETE (~17,035w, all Wraith-cleaned + Thistle-tightened, in article-2-v1.md). ALL SECTIONS DRAFTED AND EDITED. Open questions: title, naming AI, Dante. Thistle Flag A: Section VII thesis restatement frequency (pacing question). Final line: "from the inside."
