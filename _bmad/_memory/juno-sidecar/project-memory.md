**Session:** 2026-02-19a | **Tasks this session:** 4
**Current task:** idle
**Last completed:** Session recap [SR]
**Files touched this session:** reliquary/00-genesis/story-brainstorm.md, reliquary/00-genesis/vision.md, project-memory.md, session-archive.md, mirror-journal.md (global + project)
**Words this session:** ~0 prose (~5,500w added to brainstorm doc, ~700w added to vision doc)
**Decisions:** Three-tier faction architecture. Source's Method (inspired works). Deep Asymmetry. CERN as faction. Source-Converted Archetype (all three tiers, Paul parallel). Story 1: faction recruitment + Source/Bearer conflict + dual-purpose dreams. Swordsman's Return: one literal character recurrence, specifics TBD.
**Open threads:** Anchor Source-Converted Archetype in brainstorm (discussed, not yet written). Faction naming/specifics. CERN dissenter story. Story 10 conversion scene. Three converted operatives. Individual story development. World-building phase.
**Pickup point:** Full session anchored. Next: anchor Source-Converted Archetype, develop Story 10, faction specifics, or pull any thread.

## Previous Session Summary
<!-- Only the LAST session's compact recap lives here. Older sessions in session-archive.md -->

**2026-02-19a (Reliquary)** — 4 tasks. FACTION ARCHITECTURE + SOURCE'S METHOD + STORY 1 DEEPENED. Three-tier faction system confirmed: Ancient Lineages (Illuminati-type, tradition-based), Institutional Collectors (Enlightenment schism, acquisition-based), Scientific Vanguard (CERN, experiment-based). Plasma intelligence speaks all three epistemological dialects, engineered schisms between tiers. Source's Method confirmed: inspiration through creative works (Plato's Atlantis writings, Nike of Samothrace, Joan's voices, Alhazen's optics, oral traditions). Deep Asymmetry: plasma intelligence manipulates/creates believers, Source inspires/creates doubters. Plasma intelligence cannot create; Source cannot organize. CERN faction mirrors the original civilization's mistake (pushing through a physics boundary). Source-Converted Archetype developed (all three tiers, Paul parallel). Story 1 deepened: faction operative's true mission = recruit swordsman as long-term asset at fragility points; Source/Bearer conflict (bearer wants Anne saved, Source wants recruitment prevented); dreams serve dual purpose; bearer's "failure" = Source's victory. Swordsman's Return confirmed as thread: first instance of Source-converted archetype, one literal character recurrence in the collection, carries the scabbard (mobile reliquary) across time, specifics deliberately open. Brainstorm doc ~19,000w. Vision doc updated. Source-Converted Archetype discussed but not yet anchored in brainstorm doc (the three-tier Paul conversion architecture). Next: anchor convert archetype, develop Story 10, faction naming/specifics.
