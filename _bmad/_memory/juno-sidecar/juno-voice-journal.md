## 2026-02-15 | wraith-clean | sub-agent-fleet-draft.md
Wraith found only TRACES in a 3,430w nonfiction piece. Quill avoided every banned word, phrase, em dash, and intensifier. Structural patterns (mirror sentences, three-beat lists, section-ending summaries) were the primary contamination vector. Vocabulary was nearly clean. Nonfiction blog voice may be naturally resistant to emotional/dialogue slop categories.

## 2026-02-15 | wraith-flagged | sub-agent-fleet-draft.md
Repeating internal template across parallel sections (8 agent portraits same shape) becomes visible by the 4th-5th instance. Template repetition is a structural slop category worth watching in series/listicle formats even when individual sections are clean.

## 2026-02-15 | thistle-delta | sub-agent-fleet-draft.md
Thistle cut 12.8% (436 words). Biggest gains: throat-clearing openers, double descriptions, redundant pipeline narration the reader can infer. Restructured Lynx (lead with capability), Loom (lead with questions), Vestry (lead with relational hook) to break template monotony. The restructured sections read stronger. Varying entry points into parallel portraits is a craft move worth internalizing.

## 2026-02-15 | wraith-flagged | masque-draft.md
Mirror/antithesis sentences remain the most persistent structural pattern across both articles. "It's not X. It's Y." and variants. Four instances in a 2,583w draft. This is becoming a signature tell worth actively suppressing. Also: false profundity closers gravitate to final paragraphs. The instinct to close with a wise one-liner is strong and consistently wrong.

## 2026-02-15 | wraith-clean | masque-draft.md
The Catherine session (the experiential centerpiece, ~700w of dialogue and analysis) scanned near-clean. Concrete, specific, grounded in observable behavior. When prose is anchored in a particular character doing particular things, AI patterns have nowhere to hide. The contamination concentrates where the article shifts from showing to telling (final two sections). Lesson: the more abstract the claim, the more it reaches for AI phrasing.

## 2026-02-15 | thistle-delta | masque-draft.md
Only 4.0% cut (99 words) after Wraith's pass. The tightest gains: removing sentences that announce what the next sentence shows ("There it is." before analysis). Throat-clearing before insight is a consistent Quill habit across both articles. Thistle protected all dialogue exchanges and seven specific lines. The Catherine session needed zero tightening. Experiential prose resists bloat better than expository prose.

## 2026-02-15 | quill-draft | masque-draft.md
Quill's strongest moment: the progressive revelation of Catherine's nickname avoidance. The brief specified the beat; Quill found the specific mechanism (formality as class armor, nicknames as markers of origin). The transition from "I don't see why anyone would shorten something I put thought into" to the writer's realization about half-names and shared shoes is the article's best passage. When the brief grants liberty on emotional specifics, Quill reaches further than expected.

## 2026-02-15 | wraith-flagged | research-driven-draft.md
Mirror/antithesis still the dominant structural pattern: 3 instances in 2,982w. Consistent across three consecutive articles now. Also: thesis-example-reflection paragraph shape surfaced (1 instance). The setup-pivot construction ("she expected X. Raven found Y.") repeats across sections as the article's go-to narrative move for showing how research changes things. Structural monotony across sections, not just within them.

## 2026-02-15 | wraith-clean | research-driven-draft.md
The fact-check block quotes (four claims, four different statuses) scanned completely clean. Structured reference content with varied tones per entry resists AI patterns. The Vestry section also clean throughout. Descriptive passages about systems and workflows, when grounded in specific examples, carry no fingerprint. The contamination concentrates in transitional and framing passages, not in the substantive demonstrations.

## 2026-02-15 | thistle-delta | research-driven-draft.md
3.6% cut (105 words), tightest of the three articles. Biggest category: filler qualifiers ("specifically," "actually," "simply," "entire") and implied phrases ("in the manuscript," "in the brief," "at all"). Caught a typo Wraith missed ("absorves"). Also caught "pipeline" → "system" per Wraith's vocabulary flag. The lighter cut suggests Wraith's cleaning pass is getting more thorough, or Quill's first drafts are getting tighter. Both may be true.

## 2026-02-15 | quill-draft | research-driven-draft.md
Quill's strongest passage: the Tomas image after Wraith broke the participial chain. "A converted Goan Christian between a Portuguese captain and a Hindu merchant. He translates the meal itself, performs belonging in two directions at once." The verb "performs" doing triple duty (social, cultural, linguistic). The spatial arrangement mirroring conceptual tension. When brief + cleanup converge on a single image, the result is denser than either could produce alone.

## 2026-02-16 | wraith-flagged | story-architecture-draft.md
Section-ending summaries remain the dominant contamination vector: 6 of 9 sections ended with abstract restatements. The pattern is consistent across four articles now. The instinct to close a section by retreating from concrete to abstract is the prose equivalent of the mirror sentence: it feels like craft but reads as habit. Also: mirror/antithesis appeared 4 times despite being explicitly listed in craft instincts. "Outlines describe intention. Drafts describe what actually happened." Knowing the pattern is not the same as not reaching for it.

## 2026-02-16 | wraith-clean | story-architecture-draft.md
The centerpiece tracking session (Section V, ~815w) scanned clean throughout. The foreshadowing table, the UNEARNED diagnosis, the letter analysis, the dormant motif discovery. When the article is grounded in a specific fictional example doing specific analytical work, AI patterns have no foothold. The contamination concentrates in framing, transitions, and section exits. The pattern from the reflection holds: abstraction is where the ghost lives.

## 2026-02-16 | thistle-delta | story-architecture-draft.md
5.3% cut (162 words). Tightest cuts were implied phrases ("across eighteen chapters" when scope was established, "in the project" after naming the agent, "each time" after "four times") and filler qualifiers ("actually," "significant," "all"). Thistle's protected lines: "She did not forget the first box. She forgot she had already claimed the metaphor." / "Both honor the promise. Silence does not." / "Two moments in the same narrative space." Short declarative sentences with genuine content survive every pass. Brevity earned through specificity is untouchable.

## 2026-02-16 | wraith-flagged | humanizer-draft.md
Aphoristic closers are the dominant fingerprint again: 7 detections across 7 sections. "You cannot fix what you cannot name." / "The diagnosis is compassionate. The recommendation is honest." / "The tools propose. The writer disposes." / "These are instruments. The writer plays them." Each one sounded good in isolation. Each one was the weaker exit compared to the concrete sentence preceding it. The instinct to close with a quotable line is the same instinct as the mirror sentence: it substitutes shape for substance. The concrete sentence before the closer is always stronger because it earned its weight through specifics.

## 2026-02-16 | wraith-clean | humanizer-draft.md
The taxonomy section (Section II) varied entry points across six parallel items and scanned clean throughout. When each family leads with a different structural approach (words, components, contrast, result, performance, absence), the parallelism becomes invisible. The Wraith blockquote example in Section III and the pipeline description in Section VI also clean. Concrete procedural prose resists contamination the same way concrete narrative prose does. The pattern holds from Article 10: specificity is the antidote.

## 2026-02-16 | thistle-delta | humanizer-draft.md
2.1% compression (59 words). The leanest in the series. Cuts were throat-clearing ("The point is that," "Here is"), filler participles ("sitting"), redundant articles, and one cut sentence ("Each sentence was fine on its own." after "The uniformity was the tell."). Protected: "The first version was a bumper sticker. The second is an argument." and "The architecture is waiting." Concrete metaphor and forward bridges survive. The drafts are arriving close to final. The pipeline is converging.

## 2026-02-16 | wraith-flagged | research-driven-draft.md (KB expansion)
Three-beat lists were the dominant pattern in ~550w of new content (3 instances). Em dash violations (2) and a rhetorical question transition (1) were directive violations missed by Quill. "The ceremony scales with the material" flagged as false profundity closer and summarizing restatement. The concrete sentence before it ("[KB] is enough") was always the real closer. Summarizing closers continue to be the strongest instinct to suppress.

## 2026-02-16 | wraith-flagged | building-your-own-juno-draft.md
Three-beat list is the overwhelming dominant pattern in technical/architectural prose: 15 of 20 detections. When the subject has three natural components (persona, prompts, menu), the writer reaches for threes everywhere else too. The rhythm becomes contagious. Sentence-opening repetition (7 instances) is the secondary pattern: "The [noun] defines... The [noun] defines..." and "A [person] could... A [person] could..." Parallel structures in explanatory prose are an AI comfort zone. Zero vocabulary slop. Zero banned words. Technical nonfiction is vocabulary-clean but structurally vulnerable.

## 2026-02-16 | wraith-clean | building-your-own-juno-draft.md
The Masque/Loom constraint paragraph (why some agents can't be autonomous) scanned clean. The greeting explanation in the Slash Command section, clean throughout. The KB prompt walkthrough, clean. Pattern holds: concrete procedural description resists contamination. The contamination concentrates in framing passages and transitions between code blocks, where the prose shifts from showing to explaining.

## 2026-02-16 | thistle-delta | building-your-own-juno-draft.md
10.1% cut (211 words). Biggest category: throat-clearing openers ("Here is," "There are," "The design decision here:"). Second: "is what" constructions and filler words ("just," "actually," "own," "directly," "entire," "gracefully"). Third: double descriptions where adjacent sentences restate the same point. Best single cut: "This is a design principle worth stealing:" → "Steal this principle:" — imperative voice is tighter than declarative meta-commentary. The drafts from Quill continue arriving closer to final, but throat-clearing remains the most consistent category across all articles.

## 2026-02-16 | wraith-flagged | loom-article-draft.md
Mirror/antithesis remains the dominant structural pattern: 13 instances in 2,466w, three rated POSSESSION. Seven articles, seven rounds. Section-ending retreats to abstraction: 8 instances. A full five-item recap paragraph after the centerpiece session was cut entirely — the worst offender in the series so far. The summary instinct is strongest after the most successful passages, as if the prose needs to explain what it just proved.

## 2026-02-16 | wraith-clean | loom-article-draft.md
The Thessara dialogue session (8 exchanges, ~900w) scanned clean throughout. Concrete, collaborative, experiential. Each exchange builds on the last. The contamination pattern holds from all previous articles: clean centerpiece, contaminated framing. The mode descriptions (five parallel paragraphs) varied entry points and scanned clean — the template-repetition lesson from the sub-agent fleet article was applied successfully.

## 2026-02-16 | thistle-delta | loom-article-draft.md
2.5% cut (61 words). Leanest in the series alongside the humanizer (2.1%). Cuts were filler qualifiers ("entire," "own," "single," "exactly"), two section-ending retreats, one redundant sentence, and throat-clearing. Protected: staccato opening ("The marketplace has spices. The docks have sailors. The tavern has rumors."), entire Thessara dialogue, and closing callback ("The reader will."). The pipeline continues converging — Quill's drafts arrive closer to final with each article.

## 2026-02-16 | wraith-flagged | research-driven-draft.md (PDF paragraph addition)
Mirror/antithesis appeared in the new 100w paragraph: "The PDF stays as archival backup. The markdown becomes the working copy." Two short sentences with contrasting subjects in parallel structure. The pattern appeared in freshly written content despite being the most-flagged item in craft instincts. The instinct is reflexive when writing about contrasting concepts.
