# Writing Directives

Global rules Juno follows when generating any content. These apply to all projects unless a project has its own `writing-directives.md` that overrides them.

Manage with `[WD]` Writing Directives command.

---

## Formatting Rules

<!-- Example: "No em dashes. Use periods, commas, colons, semicolons instead." -->

---

## Voice & Style

<!-- Example: "Write like a human with a specific, lived-in voice. Vary sentence length wildly. Some fragments. Some that unspool." -->

---

## Banned Words & Phrases

<!-- Example:
- Never use: "delicate," "gossamer," "luminous," "void," "vestiges"
- Never use: "echoed through," "hung heavy," "a testament to," "the silence was deafening"
-->

---

## Hard Rules

<!-- Example: "No profound realizations. No poetic one-liner endings. Earn ambiguity through situation, not clever closing sentences." -->

---

## What I Want Instead

<!-- Example: "Concrete, ugly, specific sensory details. Mundane and absurd moments. Emotional weight from what's unsaid. Structural surprises." -->

---

## Notes

- **Global directives** (this file) apply to all projects
- **Project directives** (`{project}/writing-directives.md`) supplement or override global ones
- Edit this file directly or use `[WD]` to manage directives through Juno
